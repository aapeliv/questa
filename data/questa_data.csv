10.1007/bf01149327,Queueing systems with vacations ‚Äî A survey,"Queueing systems in which the server works on primary and secondary (vacation) customers arise in many computer, communication, production and other stochastic systems. These systems can frequently be modeled as queueing systems with vacations. In this survey, we give an overview of some general decomposition results and the methodology used to obtain these results for two vacation models. We also show how other related models can be solved in terms of the results for these basic models. We attempt to provide a methodological overview with the objective of illustrating how the seemingly diverse mix of problems is closely related in structure and can be understood in a common framework.",1986,1986-06,1,1,29-66,,,830,81,,1335
10.1007/bf01149326,On queueing network models of flexible manufacturing systems,"This paper outlines the state-of-the-art in studying flexible manufacturing systems (FMSs) using analytical queueing network models. These include Jackson networks, reversible networks and approximate models of non-product-form networks. The focus is on identifying the major features of the models as they relate to the operational characteristics of FMSs. Prescriptive models concerning the optimal design and/or operational control of FMS networks are also discussed.",1986,1986-06,1,1,27-May,"Buzacott, J. A. (University of Waterloo); Yao, D. D.

10.1007/bf01149328,"Assembly-like queues with finite capacity: Bounds, asymptotics and approximations","In this paper we study a queueing model of assembly-like manufacturing operations. This study was motivated by an examination of a circuit pack testing procedure in an AT & T factory. However, the model may be representative of many manufacturing assembly operations. We assume that customers fromn classes arrive according to independent Poisson processes with the same arrival rate into a single-server queueing station where the service times are exponentially distributed. The service discipline requires that service be rendered simultaneously to a group of customers consisting of exactly one member from each class. The server is idle if there are not enough customers to form a group. There is a separate waiting area for customers belonging to the same class and the size of the waiting area is the same for all classes. Customers who arrive to find the waiting area for their class full, are lost. Performance measures of interest include blocking probability, throughput, mean queue length and mean sojourn time. Since the state space for this queueing system could be large, exact answers for even reasonable values of the parameters may not be easy to obtain. We have therefore focused on two approaches. First, we find upper and lower bounds for the mean sojourn time. From these bounds we obtain the asymptotic solutions as the arrival rate (waiting room, service rate) approaches zero (infinity). Second, for moderate values of these parameters we suggest an approximate solution method. We compare the results of our approximation against simulation results and report good correspondence.",1986,1986-06,1,1,67-83,"Lipper, E. H. (Nokia (United States)); Sengupta, B.

10.1007/bf01536187,Approximation with generalized hyperexponential distributions: Weak convergence results,"Generalized hyperexponential (GH) distributions are linear combinations of exponential CDFs with mixing parameters (positive and negative) that sum to unity. The denseness of the class GH with respect to the class of all CDFs defined on [0, ‚àû) is established by showing that a GH distribution can be found that is as close to a given CDF as desired, with respect to a suitably defined metric. The metric induces the usual topology of weak convergence so that, equivalently, there exists a sequence of GH CDFs that converges weakly to a given CDF. This result is established by using a similar result for weak convergence of Erlang mixtures. Various set inclusion relations are also obtained relating the GH distributions to other commonly used classes of approximating distributions, including generalized Erlang (GE), mixed generalized Erlang (MGE), those with reciprocal polynomial Laplace transforms (Kn), those with rational Laplace transforms (Rn), and phase-type (PH) distributions. A brief survey of the history and use of approximating distributions in queueing theory is also included.",1986,1986-09,1,2,169-190,,George Mason University,54,4,,323
10.1007/bf01149329,Finite capacity assembly-like queues,"In assembly lines, service involves assembling units coming from more than one source. In queue terminology, we may consider this situation as one in which service is rendered only to groups of customers ‚Äî one from each class. In this paper we give procedures to determine response time characteristics of such a system under Markovian assumptions when a finite capacity restriction is imposed. This restriction is imposed to reflect reality as well as to make analysis tractable. In the course of this study, we also give a recursive technique to determine the distribution of the time taken for a specific number of departures in a Poisson queue from an arbitrary initial state. We demonstrate that this distribution is related to the response time distribution of the assembly-like queue. We believe that this procedure will also be of independent interest.",1986,1986-06,1,1,85-101,"Bhat, U. Narayan (Southern Methodist University)",Southern Methodist University,53,4,,126
10.1007/bf01536188,A central-limit-theorem version of L=Œªw,"Underlying the fundamental queueing formula is a relation between cumulative processes in continuous time (the integral of the queue length process) and in discrete time (the sum of the waiting times of successive customers). Except for remainder terms which usually are asymptotically negligible, each cumulative process is a random time-transformation of the other. As a consequence, in addition to the familiar relation between the with-prob ability-one limits of the averages, roughly speaking, the customer-average wait obeys a central limit theorem if and only if the time-average queue length obeys a central limit theorem, in which case both averages, properly normalized, converge in distribution jointly, and the individual limiting distributions are simply related. This relation between the central limit theorems is conveniently expressed in terms of functional central limit theorems, using the continuous mapping theorem and related arguments. The central limit theorems can be applied to compare the asymptotic efficiency of different estimators of queueing parameters. For example, when the arrival rate is known and the interarrivai times and waiting times are negatively correlated, it is more asymptotically efficient to estimate the long-run time-average queue lengthL indirectly by the sample-average of the waiting times, invoking, than it is to estimate it by the sample-average of the queue length. This variance-reduction principle extends a corresponding result for the standard GI/G/s model established by Carson and Law .",1986,1986-09,1,2,191-215,,University of Wisconsin‚ÄìMadison,34,2,,79

Retrial queues have been widely used to model many problems in telephone switching systems, telecommunication networks, computer networks and computer systems. In this paper, we discuss some important retrial queueing models and present their major analytic results and the techniques used. Our concentration is mainly on single-server queueing models.

The factorial moments of the queue length as functions of time when the queue starts empty have interesting structure, which facilitates developing approximations. Simple exponential and hyperexponential approximations for the first two moment functions help show how the queue approaches steady state as time evolves. These formulas also help determine if steady-state descriptions are reasonable when the arrival and service rates are nearly constant over some interval but the process does not start in steady state.",1987,1987-03,2,1,41-65,,,88,10,3,270

Here we adopt a personal probability point of view to all sources of uncertainty in the theory of queues and explore the consequences of our approach by comparing our results to those that are currently available. For ease of exposition, we confine attention to the M/M/1/‚àû and the M/M/1/K queues. In Part I we outline the general strategy and focus on model development.

10.1007/bf01158902,"A two-queue, one-server model with priority for the longer queue","The queueing model studied consists of one server and two queues. Each queue has its own Poisson arrival stream and service time distribution. After a service completion, the server proceeds with a customer from the longer queue, if the queues are unequal; if the queues are equal, the server chooses with some probability a customer from one of the queues. The model is of practical interest in performance analysis, but also of theoretical interest because the functional equation to be solved has not yet been studied in the queueing literature. A basic analysis of this functional equation is presented. Some numerical results are given to assess the influence of the present service discipline. Some new properties of L.S. transforms of service time distributions are discussed in the appendix.",1987,1987-09,2,3,261-283,"Cohen, J. W. (Utrecht University)",Utrecht University,32,2,3,254
10.1007/bf01158396,Polling and greedy servers on a line,"A single server moves with speed œÖ on a line interval (or a circle) of length (circumference)L. Customers, requiring service of constant durationb, arrive on the interval (or circle) at random at mean rate Œª customers per unit length per unit time. A customer's mean wait for service depends partly on the rules governing the server's motion. We compare two different servers: thepolling server and thegreedy server. Without knowing the locations of waiting customers, a polling server scans endlessly back and forth across the interval (or clockwise around the circle), stopping only where it encounters a waiting customer. Knowing where customers are waiting, a greedy server always travels toward the current nearest one. Except for certain extreme values of œÖ,L, b, andŒª, the polling and greedy servers are roughly equally effective. Indeed, the simpler polling server is often the better. Theoretical results show, in most cases, that the polling server has a high probability of moving toward the nearest customer, i.e. moving as a greedy server would. The greedy server is difficult to analyze, but was simulated on a computer.",1987,1987-06,2,2,115-145,"Coffman, E. G. (Nokia (United States)); Gilbert, E. N.

10.1007/bf01149540,An approximate analysis for a class of assembly-like queues,"Assembly-like queues model assembly operations where separate input processes deliver different types of component (customer) and the service station assembles (serves) these input requests only when the correct mix of components (customers) is present at the input. In this work, we develop an effective approximate analytical solution for an assembly-like queueing system withN(N ‚©æ 2) classes of customers formingN independent Poisson arrival streams with rates {Œªi=1,...,N} The arrival of a class of customers is ‚Äúturned off‚Äù whenever the number of customers of that class in the system exceeds the number for any of the other classes by a certain amount. The approximation is based on the decomposition of the originalN input stream stage into a cascade ofN-1 two-input stream stages. This allows one to refer to the theory of paired customer systems as a foundation of the analysis, and makes the problem computationally tractable. Performance measures such as server utilization, throughput, average delays, etc., can then be easily computed. For illustrative purposes, the theory and techniques presented are applied to the approximate analysis of a system withN = 3. Numerical examples show that the approximation is very accurate over a wide range of parameters of interest.",1987,1987-03,1,3,289-309,"Bonomi, F.

When the buffer limit is reached, arrivals will be blocked. Blocked jobs will either be lost or come back as New arrivals after a random travel time. We are concerned with the dynamic stochastic behavior of the system under different entry orders. A partial ordering is established among entry orders, and is shown to result in some quite strong orderings among the associated stochastic processes that reflect the congestion and the service characteristics of the system.

10.1007/bf01149538,Stochastic comparisons for bulk queues,"We consider two important classes of single-server bulk queueing models: M(X)/G(Y)/1 with Poisson arrivals of customer groups, and G(X)/m(Y)1 with batch service times having exponential density. In each class we compare two systems and prove that one is more congested than the other if their basic random variables are stochastically ordered in an appropriate manner. However, it must be recognized that a system that appears congested to customers might be working efficiently from the system manager's point of view. We apply the results of this comparison to (i) the family {M/G(s)/1 , s ‚©æ 1} of systems with Poisson input of customers and batch service times with varying service capacity; (ii) the family {G(s)/1 ,s ‚©æ 1} of systems with exponential customer service time density and group arrivals with varying group size; and (iii) the family {M/D/s ,s‚©æ 1} of systems with Poisson arrivals, constant service time and varying number of servers. Within each family, we find the system that is the best for customers, but this turns out to be the worst for the manager (or vice versa).

The nodes represent separate telecommunications administrations that are linked such that alternately-routed calls go through one tandem administration. The cost of the group of circuits between a pair of administrations is borne by them; and when a call between the pair is alternately routed through the tandem node, then the two administrations share the call revenue and pay transit fees to the tandem administration. The numbers of circuits between the administrations are selected to yield a least-cost network that provides a desired level of service, in terms of blocking probabilities, over an entire day. We address the problem of determining transit charges for the alternately-routed calls that are equitable for all of the administrations. Our approach is to derive such charges by equating the system-optimal circuit group sizes to certain hypothetical administration-optimal circuit group sizes. This approach may be of use in other system design problems involving cost sharing among several companies.",1987,1987-03,2,1,83-92,"Serfozo, Richard F.

The limit distributions of the estimates are obtained in a unified setting, and without imposing the ergodicity condition on the queue length process.

Such inputs include the cases of i.i.d, regenerative, Markov modulated, Markov renewal and the output from some queues as well. Since a HRMC is regenerative, the queue inherits the regenerative structure. As examples, we consider split & match, tandem, G/G/c and more general skip forward networks.

In each case the mixing density is a minor modification of a beta density.

This paper describes a simulation study of the behavior of such a service operation. The results are compared with the steady-state solutions to a queueing model where individual scheduling time periods are assumed to be independent.

Tasks requiring a deterministic amount of service time, arrive randomly to the queues and have to be served by the server. One of the queues has priority over the other in the sense that it always attempts to get the server, while the other queue attempts only randomly according to a rule that depends on how long the task at the head of the queue has been waiting in that position. The class considered is characterized by the fact that if both queues compete and attempt to get the server simultaneously, then they both fail and the server remains idle for a deterministic amount of time. For this class we derive the steady-state joint generating function of the state probabilities.

This is done by simulating the network and showing that the sojourn times generally pass a Kolmogorov-Smirnov test as having come from the approximating distribution. Since the sum of dependent random variables may have the same distribution as the sum of independent random variables with the same marginal distributions, it is conceivable that our approximation is exact. However, we numerically compute upper and lower bounds for the distribution of the total sojourn time; these bounds are so close that the approximating distribution lies outside of the bounds.

Under certain restrictions, the work conservation property gives rise to a conservation law for mean waiting times, i.e., a linear relation between the mean waiting times of the various classes of customers. This paper is devoted to single-server multi-class service systems in which work conservation is violated in the sense that the server's activities may be interrupted although work is still present. For a large class of such systems with interruptions, a decomposition of the amount of work into two independent components is obtained; one of these components is the amount of work in the corresponding systemwithout interruptions. The work decomposition gives rise to a (pseudo)conservation law for mean waiting times, just as work conservation did for the system without interruptions.",1989,1989-11,5,3-Jan,185-214,"Boxma, O. J.

Customers of type A require service only at station 1 and customers of type B require service first at station 1 and then at station 2. Each server has a different general service time distribution, and each customer type has a different general interarrival time distribution. The problem is to find a dynamic sequencing policy at station 1 that minimizes the long-run average expected number of customers in the system.The scheduling problem is approximated by a dynamic control problem involving Brownian motion. A reformulation of this control problem is solved, and the solution is interpreted in terms of the queueing system in order to obtain an effective sequencing policy. Also, a pathwise lower bound (for any sequencing policy) is obtained for the total number of customers in the network. We show via simulation that the relative difference between the performance of the proposed policy and the pathwise lower bound becomes small as the load on the network is increased toward the heavy traffic limit.",1989,1989-12,5,4,265-279,"Harrison, J.

10.1007/bf01149184,Markovian network processes: Congestion-dependent routing and processing,"A Markovian network process describes the movement of discrete units among a set of nodes that process the units. There is considerable knowledge of such networks, often called queueing networks, in which the nodes operate independently and the routes of the units are independent. The focus of this study, in contrast, is on networks with dependent nodes and routings. Examples of dependencies are parallel processing across several nodes, blocking of transitions because of capacity constraints on nodes, alternate routing of units to avoid congestion, and accelerating or decelerating the processing rate at a node depending on downstream congestion. We introduce a general network process representing the numbers of units at the nodes and derive its equilibrium distribution. This distribution takes the form of a product of functions of vectors in which the arguments of the functions satisfy an interchangeability property. This new type of distribution may apply to other multi-variate processes as well. A basic idea in our approach is a linking of certain micro-level balance properties of the network routing to the processing rates at the nodes. The link is via ‚Äú routing-balance partitions‚Äù of nodes that are inherent in any network. A byproduct of this approach is a general characterization of blocking of transitions without the restriction that the process is reversible, which had been a standard assumption. We also give necessary and sufficient conditions under which a unit moving in the network sees a time average for the unmoved units (called the MUSTA property). Finally, we discuss when certain flows between nodes in an open network are Poisson processes.",1989,1989-11,5,3-Jan,May-36,"Serfozo, Richard F.

The server works according to the gated process-sharing discipline. In this discipline, the server provides service to a batch of at mostm customers at a time. Once a batch of customers begins service, no other waiting customer can receive service until all members of the batch have completed their service. For this queue, we derive performance characteristics, such as waiting time distribution, queue length distribution etc. For this queue, it is possible to obtain the mean conditional response time for a customer whose service time is known. This conditional response time is a nonlinear function (as opposed to the linear case for the ordinary processor-sharing queue). A special case of the queue (where) has an interesting and unusual solution. For this special case, the size of the batch for service is a Markov chain whose steady state distribution can be explicitly written down.

10.1007/bf01158473,Numerical investigation of a multiserver retrial model,"We consider a queueing model in which customers arrive in a Poisson stream to be served by one ofc servers. Each arriving customer enters a pool of active customers and starts generating requests for service at exponentially distributed time intervals at rate œÉ until he finds a free server and begins service. An analytical solution of this model is difficult and does not lend itself to numerical implementation. In this paper, we make a simplifying approximation, based on understanding of the physical behavior of the system, which yields an infinitesimal generator with a modified matrix-geometric equilibrium probability vector. That vector can be very efficiently computed even for high congestion levels. Illustrative numerical examples demonstrate the effectiveness of the approximation as well as the effect of the retrial rate on the system behavior for various levels of congestion. This study shows how numerical results for analytically intractable systems can be obtained by combining intuition with efficient algorithmic methods.",1990,1990-06,7,2,169-189,"Neuts, Marcel F.

New customers arrive at the service station according to a Poisson process and demand i.i.d. service times. If the server is idle, the incoming customer starts getting served immediately. If the server is busy, the incoming customer conducts a retrial after an exponential amount of time. The retrial customers behave independently of each other. The server stays up for an exponential time and then fails. Repair times have a general distribution. The failure/repair behavior when the server is idle is different from when it is busy. Two different models are considered. In model I, the failed server cannot be occupied and the customer whose service is interrupted has to either leave the system or rejoin the retrial group. In model II, the customer whose service is interrupted by a failure stays at the server and restarts the service when repair is completed. Model II can be handled as a special case of model I. For model I, we derive the stability condition and study the limiting behavior of the system by using the tools of Markov regenerative processes.",1990,1990-06,7,2,191-208,"Kulkarni, V. G.

10.1007/bf02411463,The QNET method for two-moment analysis of open queueing networks,"Consider an open network of single-server stations, each with a first-in-first-out discipline. The network may be populated by various customer types, each with its own routing and service requirements. Routing may be either deterministic or stochastic, and the interarrival and service time distributions may be arbitrary. In this paper a general method for steady-state performance analysis is described and illustrated. This analytical method, called QNET, uses both first and second moment information, and it is motivated by heavy traffic theory. However, our numerical examples show that QNET compares favorably with W. Whitt's Queueing Network Analyzer (QNA) and with other approximation schemes, even under conditions of light or moderate loading.In the QNET method one first replaces the original queueing network by what we call an approximating Brownian system model, and then one computes the stationary distribution of the Brownian model. The second step amounts to solving a certain highly structured partial differential equation problem; a promising general approach to the numerical solution of that PDE problem is described by Harrison and Dai [8] in a companion paper. Thus far the numerical solution technique has been implemented only for two-station networks, and it is clear that the computational burden will grow rapidly as the number of stations increases. Thus we also describe and investigate a cruder approach to two-moment network analysis, called Œ†NET, which is based on a product form approximation, or decomposition approximation, to the stationary distribution of the Brownian system model.In very broad terms, Œ†NET is comparable to QNA in its level of sophistication, whereas QNET captures more subtle system interactions. In our numerical examples the performance of Œ†NET and QNA is similar; the performance of QNET is generally better, sometimes much better.",1990,1990-12,6,1,Jan-32,"Harrison, J.

10.1007/bf02411475,Single line queue with repeated demands,"We analyze a model of a queueing system in which customers can only call in to request service: if the server is free, the customer enters service immediately, but if the service system is occupied, the unsatisfied customer must break contact and reinitiate his request later. Such a customer is said to be in ‚Äúorbit‚Äù. In this paper we consider three models characterized by the discipline governing the order of re-request of service from orbit. First, all customers in orbit can reapply, but are discouraged and reduce their rate of demand as more customers join the orbit. Secondly, the FCFS discipline operates for the unsatisfied customers in orbit. Finally, the LCFS discipline governs the customers in orbit and the server takes an exponentially distributed vacation after each service is completed. We calculate several characteristics quantities of such systems, assuming a general service-time distribution and different exponential distributions for the times between arrivals of first and repeat requests.",1990,1990-12,6,1,223-228,"Farahmand, K.

The convergence of the series is accelerated by applying a modified form of the epsilon algorithm. Attention is paid to economic use of memory space.,1990,1990-12,6,1,173-188,"Blanc, J. P. C.

We thereby generalize the matrix-exponential results of Sengupta for GI/PH/1 and of Neuts for MMPP/G/1 to substantially more general models. Our derivation of the results also establishes the equivalence of the methods of Neuts and those of Sengupta. A detailed analysis of the queue GI/N/1 is given, and it is noted that not only the stationary distribution at arrivals but also at an arbitrary time is matrix-geometric. Matrix-exponential steady state distributions are established for the waiting times in the queue GI/N/1. From this, by appealing to the duality theorem of Ramaswami, it is deduced that the stationary virtual and actual waiting times in a GI/PH/1 queue are of phase type.",1990,1990-12,6,1,229-260,,,33,0,,194
10.1007/bf02411482,Queues with service times and interarrival times depending linearly and randomly upon waiting times,"We consider a modification of the standard G/G/1 queue with unlimited waiting space and the first-in first-out discipline in which the service times and interarrival times depend linearly and randomly on the waiting times. In this model the waiting times satisfy a modified version of the classical Lindley recursion. We determine when the waiting-time distributions converge to a proper limit and we develop approximations for this steady-state limit, primarily by applying previous results of Vervaat [21] and Brandt [4] for the unrestricted recursion Yn+1=CnYn+Xn. Particularly appealing for applications is a normal approximation for the stationary waiting time distribution in the case when the queue only rarely becomes empty. We also consider the problem of scheduling successive interarrival times at arrival epochs, with the objective of achieving nearly maximal throughput with nearly bounded waiting times, while making the interarrival time sequence relatively smooth. We identify policies depending linearly and deterministically upon the work in the system which meet these objectives reasonably well; with these policies the waiting times are approximately contained in a specified interval a specified fraction of time.",1990,1990-12,6,1,335-351,"Whitt, Ward (Nokia (United States))",Nokia (United States),32,3,,166
10.1007/bf01154550,Estimating variance of output from cyclic exponential queueing systems,"Production systems, particularly those making use of a ‚Äúpull‚Äù production control mechanism, are well-modeled as closed queueing networks. Average throughput is clearly one important performance measure for these systems. However, many control decisions require information concerning the variability of the output process as well as throughput. Because of this, the standard deviation of the number of outputs during a specified interval is a practical performance measure for production systems.In this paper, we consider the standard deviation of the number of outputs during a time interval from a closed queueing network consisting ofM single server exponential queues. Because computing this quantity exactly is extremely cumbersome, we introduce a simple approximation that makes use of (1) known results for the variance of the time a marked job takes to complete a round trip and (2) an approximate correction term for the covariance between successive round trips. We show through comparisons with simulation that our method is quite accurate under a variety of conditions.",1990,1990-09,7,4-Mar,337-353,"Duenyas, Izak (Northwestern University); Hopp, Wallace J.

10.1007/bf01154544,Conditional and unconditional distributions forM/G/1 type queues with server vacations,"M/G/1 queues with server vacations have been studied extensively over the last two decades. Recent surveys by Boxma [3], Doshi [5] and Teghem [14] provide extensive summary of literature on this subject. More recently, Shanthikumar [11] has generalized some of the results toM/G/1 type queues in which the arrival pattern during the vacations may be different from that during the time the server is actually working. In particular, the queue length at the departure epoch is shown to decompose into two independent random variables, one of which is the queue length at the departure epoch (arrival epoch, steady state) in the correspondingM/G/1 queue without vacations. Such generalizations are important in the analysis of situations involving reneging, balking and finite buffer cyclic server queues. In this paper we consider models similar to the one in Shanthikumar [11] but use the work in the system as the starting point of our investigation. We analyze the busy and idle periods separately and get conditional distributions of work in the system, queue length and, in some cases, waiting time. We then remove the conditioning to get the steady state distributions. Besides deriving the new steady state results and conditional waiting time and queue length distributions, we demonstrate that the results of Boxma and Groenendijk [2] follow as special cases. We also provide an alternative approach to deriving Shanthikumar's [11] results for queue length at departure epochs.",1990,1990-09,7,4-Mar,229-251,"Doshi, Bharat (Nokia (United States))",Nokia (United States),25,1,,67

Only one of the servers is active when the number of customers in the system does not exceed a prescribed threshold, whereas both are active above the threshold. The problem of determining the equilibrium density of the waiting time is formulated. A generating function is given for the Laplace transform of the density of the waiting time, and it is pointed out that it leads to an explicit expression for this quantity. Explicit expressions are obtained for the first and second moments of the waiting and sojourn times, and they are compared with the corresponding quantities for a single-server system with the same state-dependent mean service rates.",1990,1990-09,7,4-Mar,325-336,"Morrison, J.

If a service is in progress at the end of a shift, the server works overtime to complete the service. This process was motivated by the behavior of fishermen interviewed in the NY Great Lakes Creel Survey.We derive the distributions of the number of services (X), overtime and total server idle time (T), both unconditionally (for Poisson arrivals) and conditionally on the number (n) of arrivals per shift, assuming that the arrival times are not recorded in the data. These distributions provide the basis for estimation of the parameters from asingle realization of the queueing process during [0,L]. The conditional distributions also can be used to estimate common service time,w, when (n, X) or (n, T) are observed. Confidence intervals based onT are of shorter length, for all confidence coefficients, than the corresponding intervals based onX.",1990,1990-09,7,4-Mar,283-306,"Rubin, Gail (Cornell University); Robson, Douglas S.

The conjecture is motivated by known heavy traffic limit theorems for some special cases of the general model, and some conjectured ‚ÄúHeavy Traffic Principles‚Äù derived from them.Using the known stationary distribution of one-dimensional reflected Brownian motion, we present expressions for the heavy traffic limit of stationary queue length and sojourn time distributions and moments.

Patients, clerks, technicians, doctors and nurses agreed that the clerical registration area was the major bottleneck in the system. Our first reaction was to simulate the system with special attention on the complex registration procedure. Time constraints on data collection and program development led us to a queueing network model and QNA, a software tool for analyzing queueing networks developed by Whitt. The queueing analysis showed the registration area was not the bottleneck and we conjectured that delays were due to scheduling problems. A preliminary trial in the clinic of a modified appointment system showed promise with a 20 minute reduction in average time in the system (based on a small sample).

One option that a number of these cities have considered for improving service and cutting costs is training personnel to handle both police and fire roles. In this paper we describe a hierarchy of models that we have used to assess the performance viability of a merger as well as to design specific deployment plans. The modeling environment is more complex than a traditional police or fire system. We need to model the response pattern of four or more patrol units along with the simultaneous dispatch of fire equipment from one or more fire stations. The major contribution of the paper is the manner in which a series of models is linked together to forecast a wide range of performance measures under differing dispatch assumptions. We use a queueing model of police patrol to calculate steady state probabilities and expected delays without preemption. We then model two types of preemptive dispatch strategies utilized in responding initially to a major fire by superimposing a binomial distribution on the basic queueing model. There is also a travel time simulation model to calculate conditional expected response time statistics. The queueing models and the travel time simulation are then combined to estimate unconditional expected values.

The traffic is expected to be highly bursty and variable at the source and consequently a key issue is admission control. We study a 4-parameter device called a regulator which acts as a policing device as well as a traffic shaper. The device is a generalized leaky bucket with a data buffer, a token buffer supplied by a constant-rate token stream, and a peak rate controller; the outputs of the device are streams of priority and marked cells. The composite system comprising of the source and the regulator is represented in a stochastic fluid model since fluid flow has been found to have properties well matched to the ATM environment, and the Markov Modulated Fluid Source allows bursty characteristics to be accurately modelled. A complete procedure based on spectral expansions for calculating the system's stationary state distribution is given. It is shown that with proper design the regulator effectively controls a three-way trade-off between throughput, delay and burstiness. Numerical results reveal that performance is sensitive to source characteristics such as the squared coefficient of variation of burst and silent periods. The second part of the paper characterizes the output of the regulator. The distributions of the time periods spent in the various states by the output process are calculated exactly. From this an approximate Markovian characterization is obtained. The output streams of priority and marked cells are coupled to capture their correlations. For the simple case of two-state on-off sources, the approximate Markovian characterization of the regulator's output rate processes is explicitly given and it is distinguished by the property that all moments are identical to those of the actual processes. With this characterization an original goal of analyzing a composite system of access regulation and statistical multiplexing is separated, decomposed and thereby made tractable.",1991,1991-03,9,2-Jan,29-63,"Elwalid, Anwar I.

This principle is now well known and frequently applied. However, in recent years there have been extensions, such as H=ŒªG and the continuous, distributional, ordinal and central-limit-theorem versions, which show that theL=ŒªW relation, when viewed properly, has much more power than was previously realized.

On arrival a job joins the shortest queue and in case both queues have equal lengths, he joins the first queue with probabilityq and the second one with probability 1 ‚àíq, whereq is an arbitrary number between 0 and 1. In a previous paper we showed for the symmetric problem, that is for equal service rates and q = 1/2, that the equilibrium distribution of the lengths of the two queues can be exactly represented by an infinite sum of product form solutions by using an elementary compensation procedure. The main purpose of the present paper is to prove a similar product form result for the asymmetric problem by using a generalization of the compensation procedure. Furthermore, it is shown that the product form representation leads to a numerically efficient algorithm. Essentially, the method exploits the convergence properties of the series of product forms. Because of the fast convergence an efficient method is obtained with upper and lower bounds for the exact solution. For states further away from the origin the convergence is faster.

The mean service time of each customer is the same for each cycle. We determine the joint distribution of the successive sojourn times of a tagged customer at his loops through the system. Subsequently we let the mean service time at each loop shrink to zero and the feedback probabilities approach one in such a way that the mean total required service time remains constant. The behaviour of the feedback queue then approaches that of an M/G/1 processor sharing queue, different choices of the feedback probabilities leading to different service time distributions in the processor sharing model. This is exploited to analyse the sojourn time distribution in theM/G/1 queue with processor sharing.Some variants are also considered, viz., an M/M/1 feedback queue with additional customers who are always present, and an M/G/1 processor sharing queue with feedback.",1991,1991-12,9,4,365-401,"van den Berg, J.

Examples include the Token Ring network and a communications switch. The common property of these systems is the need to efficiently share a single resource (server) among N entities (stations). In spite of the massive research effort in this area, very little work has been devoted to the issue of how toefficiently operate these systems.In the present paper we deal with this problem, namely with how to efficiently allocate the server's attention among theN stations. We consider a framework in which a predetermined fixed visit order (polling table) is used to establish the order by which the server visits the stations, and we address the problem of how to construct an efficient (optimal) polling table. In selecting a polling table the objective is to minimize the mean waiting cost of the system, a weighted sum of the mean delays with arbitrary cost parameters. Since the optimization problem involved is very hard, we use an approximate approach. Using two independent analyses, based on a lower bound and on mean delay approximations, we derive very simple rules for the determination of efficient polling tables. The two rules are very similar and even coincide in most cases. Extensive numerical examination shows that the rules perform well and that in most cases the system operates very close to its optimal operation point.",1991,1991-03,9,2-Jan,133-162,"Boxma, O. J.

We determine the asymptotic form of the blocking probabilities for all customer classes in the regime known as critical loading, where both the number of servers and offered load are large and almost equal. Asymptotically, the blocking probability of classj customers is proportional toMj. This asymptotic result provides an approximation for the blocking probabilities which is reasonably accurate. We also consider the behavior of the Erlang fixed point (reduced load approximation) for this model under critical loading. Although the blocking probability of classj customers given by the Erlang fixed point is again asymptotically proportional toMj, the Erlang fixed point typically gives the wrong limit. Next we show that under critical loading the throughputs have a pleasingly simple form of monotonicity with respect to arrival rates: the throughput of classi is increasing in the arrival rate of classi and decreasing in the arrival rate of classj for j‚â†i.

Such a system can also be described in terms of servicing machines processes with reserve replacement and multi-channel queues with finite waiting room. Two dual models, with and without idle periods, are treated. An explicit relation between the servicing processes of both models is derived.

Though this non-interacting property (NIP) has been instrumental in facilitating excellent results for infinite server systems in the past, the utility of this property has not been fully exploited or even fully recognized. This paper exploits theNIP by investigating a general infinite server system with batch arrivals following a Markov renewal input process. The batch sizes and service times depend on the customer types which are regulated by the Markov renewal process.

In the process we summarize what we have learnt in our recent work and, also, we give indications of the direction of our future work. Our scheme integrates feedback and open loop control. The feedback control is exercised by sliding windows; access controllers regulate bursty sources. All our design proposals are rooted in asymptotic analyses; the justification for asymptotics comes from the largeness of the parameters, such as propagation delay, speed, window size, buffer size, and the number of virtual circuits. This analysis makes a strong case for operating in a specific ‚Äú moderate usage‚ Äù regime, and adaptive dynamic windowing algorithms are given that make this happen; moreover, when in this regime, buffers may be sized aggressively small without jeopardizing performance and the simplicity of the retransmission protocol.

Simplifying assumptions for the operation of the MAC layer protocol lead to a simple expression for the average end-to-end delay in terms of the effective loads on the LAN segments.The problem of optimally locating bridges and repeaters on the nodes in order to minimize the average delay is then studied. It is shown that this problem is equivalent to the set partitioning problem, which is NP-complete, but for which good algorithms exist to solve large problems. The related problem of minimizing cost subject to a constraint on average end-to-end delay is also discussed.

10.1007/bf01158796,A heavy-traffic comparison of shared and segregated buffer schemes for queues with the head-of-line processor-sharing discipline,"As network speeds increase and the data traffic becomes more diverse, the need arises for service disciplines that offer fair treatment to diverse applications, while efficiently using resources at high speeds. Disciplines that approximate round-robin or processor-sharing service per channel are well suited for data networks because, over a wide range of time scales, they allocate bandwidth fairly among channels without needing to distinguish between different types of applications. This study is among the few to address head-of-line processor sharing. In most previous models of processor-sharing disciplines, the system immediately serves any arriving message at a rate depending only on the number of messages in the system regardless of how these messages are distributed among the channels. This model is commonly called pure processor sharing. In our model, the server completes the work from a given channel at a rate depending on the number of other channels with work in the system. That is, the service rate depends on how messages are distributed among the channels, and only indirectly on the total number of messages in the system. In this paper, we contrast the buffer requirements of shared and non-shared buffer schemes, when both types of schemes provide head-of-the-line processor-sharing service among channels. We formulate the problem as a system of functions representing the cumulative input and cumulative lost (potential) output to parts of the queueing system and model the vector of input functions as a multi-dimensional Brownian motion. The resulting heavy-traffic approximations predict much larger benefits from sharing buffers than those predicted by pure processor sharing.",1991,1991-03,9,2-Jan,163-190,"Fendick, Kerry W.

When customers leave the first queue they can be routed to either the second or third queue. Thus, a customer that traverses the network by going from the first to the second to the third queue, can be overtaken by another customer that is routed from the first queue directly to the third. We study the distribution of the sojourn time of a customer through the three node network, in the heavy traffic limit. A three term heavy traffic asymptotic approximation to the sojourn time density is derived. The leading term shows that the nodes decouple in the heavy traffic limit. The next two terms, however, do show the dependence of the sojourn times at the individual nodes and give quantitative measures of the effects of overtaking.",1991,1991-12,8,1,165-182,"Knessl, C.

For a fixed average number of calls per slot, it is shown that increasing the number of slots per frame increases the stationary number of packets in the buffer in the sense of increasing convex ordering. Using this, it is shown that the stationary number of packets in the buffer is bounded from above by the number of packets in a stationary discreteM/D/1 queue with arrival rate K/C and unit service time.

It is shown that the stationary distribution of the system state is insensitive not only with respect to the service time distributions but also with respect to the general entrance and exit rules. As well as the insensitivity of the service scheme, our results are obtained for a special form of state and customer type dependent arrival and service rates.

The performance measures of interest are the number of messages exchanged (communication complexity) and the execution time (time complexity). Classical models use a ‚Äúsynchronism assumption‚ Äù according to which all processors start at the same time and message delays are constant.We attempt to capture the essential asynchronism of this class of algorithms by using probabilistic models. Two such models are discussed, one in discrete and one in continuous time. In each case, both the uni- and the bidirectional cases are studied and compared. We obtain expressions for the distributions of the number of exchanged messages and derive their asymptotic behavior whenn, the number of processors in the ring, grows large. The results show how the communication complexity actually depends on the speed of communcations on the ring, and what is the interest of having bidirectional communications.We also address in part the evaluation of the completion time of the algorithm. This time decomposes into astartup time and anexploration time.

10.1007/bf01158520,The Fourier-series method for inverting transforms of probability distributions,"This paper reviews the Fourier-series method for calculating cumulative distribution functions (cdf's) and probability mass functions (pmf's) by numerically inverting characteristic functions, Laplace transforms and generating functions. Some variants of the Fourier-series method are remarkably easy to use, requiring programs of less than fifty lines. The Fourier-series method can be interpreted as numerically integrating a standard inversion integral by means of the trapezoidal rule. The same formula is obtained by using the Fourier series of an associated periodic function constructed by aliasing; this explains the name of the method. This Fourier analysis applies to the inversion problem because the Fourier coefficients are just values of the transform. The mathematical centerpiece of the Fourier-series method is the Poisson summation formula, which identifies the discretization error associated with the trapezoidal rule and thus helps bound it. The greatest difficulty is approximately calculating the infinite series obtained from the inversion integral. Within this framework, lattice cdf's can be calculated from generating functions by finite sums without truncation. For other cdf's, an appropriate truncation of the infinite series can be determined from the transform based on estimates or bounds. For Laplace transforms, the numerical integration can be made to produce a nearly alternating series, so that the convergence can be accelerated by techniques such as Euler summation. Alternatively, the cdf can be perturbed slightly by convolution smoothing or windowing to produce a truncation error bound independent of the original cdf. Although error bounds can be determined, an effective approach is to use two different methods without elaborate error analysis. For this purpose, we also describe two methods for inverting Laplace transforms based on the Post-Widder inversion formula. The overall procedure is illustrated by several queueing examples.",1992,1992-01,10,2-Jan,May-87,,Nokia (United States),489,33,,1590
10.1007/bf01159287,On optimal polling policies,"In a single-server polling system, the server visits the queues according to a routing policy and while at a queue, serves some or all of the customers there according to a service policy. A polling (or scheduling) policy is a sequence of decisions on whether to serve a customer, idle the server, or switch the server to another queue. The goal of this paper is to find polling policies that stochastically minimize the unfinished work and the number of customers in the system at all times. This optimization problem is decomposed into three subproblems: determine the optimal action (i.e., serve, switch, idle) when the server is at a nonempty queue; determine the optimal action (i.e., switch, idle) when the server empties a queue; determine the optimal routing (i.e., choice of the queue) when the server decides to switch. Under fairly general assumptions, we show for the first subproblem that optimal policies are greedy and exhaustive, i.e., the server should neither idle nor switch when it is at a nonempty queue. For the second subproblem, we prove that in symmetric polling systems patient policies are optimal, i.e., the server should stay idling at the last visited queue whenever the system is empty. When the system is slotted, we further prove that non-idling and impatient policies are optimal. For the third subproblem, we establish that in symmetric polling systems optimal policies belong to the class of Stochastically Largest Queue (SLQ) policies. An SLQ policy is one that never routes the server to a queue known to have a queue length that is stochastically smaller than that of another queue.

The polling discipline in each queue is of general gated-type or exhaustive-type. We assume that in each queue the arrival times form a Poisson process, and that the service times, the walking times, as well as the set-up times form sequences of independent and identically distributed random variables. For such a system, we provide a sufficient condition under which the vector of queue lengths is stable. We treat several criteria for stability: the ergodicity of the process, the geometric ergodicity, and the geometric rate of convergence of the first moment. The ergodicity implies the weak convergence of station times, intervisit times and cycle times. Next, we show that the queue lengths, station times, intervisit times and cycle times are stochastically increasing in arrival rates, in service times, in walking times and in setup times. The stability conditions and the stochastic monotonicity results are extended to the polling systems with additional customer routing between the queues, as well as bulk and correlated arrivals. Finally, we prove that the mean cycle time, the mean intervisit time and the mean station times are invariant under general service disciplines and general stationary arrival and service processes.",1992,1992-03,11,2-Jan,35-57,,,67,0,,103

Customers arrive at the queues from outside the network according to independent Poisson processes. Upon completion of his service, a customer mayleave the network, berouted to another queue in the network orrejoin the same queue for another portion of service. The single server moves through the different queues of the network in a cyclic manner. Whenever the server arrives at a queue (polls the queue), he serves the waiting customers in that queue according to some service discipline. Both the gated and the exhaustive disciplines are considered. When moving from one queue to the next queue, the server incurs a switch-over period. This queueing network model has many applications in communication, computer, robotics and manufacturing systems. Examples include token rings, single-processor multi-task systems and others. For this model, we derive the generating function and the expected number of customers present in the network queues at arbitrary epochs, and compute the expected values of the delays observed by the customers. In addition, we derive the expected delay of customers that follow a specific route in the network, and we introduce pseudo-conservation laws for this network of queues.",1992,1992-03,11,2-Jan,121-144,"Sidi, Moshe (Technion ‚Äì Israel Institute of Technology); Levy, Hanoch (Tel Aviv University); Fuhrmann, Steve W.

This decomposition does not apply to all polling models, but does, for example, apply to models with constant switch-over times and either exhaustive or gated service disciplines. For such models, we show that the population of customers present in the system (represented by a vector indicating the number of customers at each queue) at key time points breaks into two independent subpopulations: (1) the population of customers present in the related model with zero switch-over times; (2) another population, which is particularly easy to analyze.

For the purpose of numerical discussions of idle- and interdeparture-time distributions, the interarrival-time distribution is also taken to belong to the class R. It is also shown that numerical computations of the idle-time distribution of  R/G/1 queues can be done even ifG is not taken asR. Throughout the discussions it is assumed that the queue discipline is first-come-first-served (FCFS). For the tail of the actual queueing-time distribution of GI/R/1, approximations in terms of one or more roots of the c.e. are also discussed. If more than one root is used, they are taken in ascending order of magnitude. Numerical aspects have been tested for a variety of complex interarrival- and service-time distributions. The analysis is not restricted to generalized distributions with phases such as Coxian-n (Cn), but also covers nonphase type distributions such as uniform (U) and deterministic (D).

The corresponding queueing model was discussed recently by Lederman, but only the model with losses has been studied analytically.

Then, we reduce the problem of obtaining the QS distribution to determining the Perron-Frobenius eigenvalue of some Hessenberg matrix. Based on these arguments, we develop a numerical algorithm to compute the QS distributions. The doubly-limiting conditional distribution is also obtained by following this approach.

An additional measure of packet loss is necessary to adequately assess the quality of each real-time connection. The additional measure considered here is the average number of consecutively lost packets, also called the average packet gap. We derive a closed form for the average packet gap for the multiclass G/G/m/B queueing system in equilibrium and show that it only depends on the loss behavior of two consecutive packets. This result considerably simplifies the monitoring process of real-time packet traffic sessions.

In this service mechanism, each queue, after receiving service on cyclej, makes a reservation for its service requirement in cycle j + 1. The main contribution to queueing theory is that we propose an approximation for the queue length and sojourn-time distributions for this discipline.

This paper presents a strengthening of ASTA under the original LAA of Wolff. We consider a stochastic processX with an associated point processN that admits a stochastic intensity and satisfies LAA. Various authors have noted in various contexts that ASTA holds if and only if the arrival intensity is state independent. For a class of point processes that includes doubly stochastic as well as ordinary Poisson processes, we prove that the point process obtained by restricting the process X to any given set of states not only has the same intensity but also the same probabilistic structure as the original point process. In particular, if the original point process is Poisson, the new point process is still Poisson with the same parameter as the original point process. For a discrete-time version, of interest in its own right, we provide a simple proof of a strengthened version of ASTA in discrete time. Unlike other discrete-time versions of ASTA, ours is valid for point processes with stationary but not necessarily independent increments. The continuous-time results are obtained using martingale theory. A corollary is a simple proof of PASTA under conditions that require only that the relevant limits exist.

The distribution functions may be of a general form. The study is based on perturbation analysis of queueing networks. A new concept, the realization factor of a perturbation, is introduced for the network studied. The properties of realization factors are discussed, and a set of linear differential equations specifying the realization factors are derived. The sensitivity of the steady-state performance with respect to a parameter can be expressed in a simple form using realization factors. Based on this, the sensitivity can be estimated by applying a perturbation analysis algorithm to a sample path of the system. We show that the derivative of the performance measure with respect to a parameter based on a single sample path converges with probability one to the derivative of the steady-state performance as the length of the sample path goes to infinity. The results provide a new analytical method of calculating performance sensitivities and justifies the application of perturbation analysis algorithms to non-Markovian queueing networks.",1992,1992-12,10,4,313-350,,,4,0,,54

This procedure requires the server to have no advance information concerning the number of messages resident at a station prior to its visit to the station. Messages arriving at each station belong to one of two priority classes: class-1 (high priority) and class-2 (low priority). Class-1 messages are served under an exhaustive service discipline, while class-2 messages are served under a limited service discipline. Class-1 messages have non-preemptive priority over class-2 messages resident at the same station. Using a fully symmetric system model, an exact expression for the sum of the mean waiting times of class-1 and class-2 messages is first derived.

In this paper, we present ‚Äúinsensitivity‚Äù theorems and thereby equilibrium distributions for two discrete time queueing models in which the server may change from one customer to another after completion of each segment of service. In the first model, exactly one segment of service is provided at each time point whether or not an arrival occurs, while in the second model, at most one arrival or service occurs at each time point. In each model, customers of typet request a service time which consists ofl segments in succession with probability bt(l). Examples are given which illustrate the application of the theorems to round robin queues, to queues with a persistent server, and to queues in which server transition probabilities do not depend on the server's previous position. In addition, for models in which the probability that the server moves from one position to another depends only on the distance between the positions, an amalgamation procedure is proposed which gives an insensitive model on a coarse state space even though a queue may not be insensitive on the original state space.

The result is that the next station beyond the parallel bank of servers can be approximated by a non-Markovian bulk arrival system. This station sees batch arrivals of customers that are eligible to receive service. The size of the arriving batches is shown to depend on the inter-arrival times.

10.1007/bf01158930,Re-entrant lines,"Traditionally, manufacturing systems have mainly been treated as either job shops or flow shops. In job shops, parts may arrive with random routes, with each route having a low volume. In flow shops, the routes are fixed and acyclic, as in assembly lines. With the advent of semiconductor manufacturing plants, and more recently, thin film lines, this dichotomy needs to be expanded to consider another class of systems, which we call ‚Äúre-entrant lines‚Äù. The distinguishing feature of these manufacturing systems is that parts visit some machines more than once at different stages of processing.Scheduling problems arise because several parts at different stages of processing may be in contention with each other for service at the same machine. There may be uncertainties in the form of random service or set-up times, as well as random machine failures and repairs. The goal of scheduling is to improve performance measures such as mean sojourn time in the system, which is also known as the mean ‚Äúcycle-time‚Äù, or the variance of the cycle-time.In this paper we provide a tutorial account of some recent results in this field. We describe several scheduling policies of interest, and provide some results concerning their stability and performance. Several open problems are suggested.",1993,1993-03,13,3-Jan,87-110,"Kumar, P.

10.1007/bf01158933,Networks of infinite-server queues with nonstationary Poisson input,"In this paper we focus on networks of infinite-server queues with nonhomogeneous Poisson arrival processes. We start by introducing a more general Poisson-arrival-location model (PALM) in which arrivals move independently through a general state space according to a location stochastic process after arriving according to a nonhomogeneous Poisson process. The usual open network of infinite-server queues, which is also known as a linear population process or a linear stochastic compartmental model, arises in the special case of a finite state space. The mathematical foundation is a Poisson-random-measure representation, which can be obtained by stochastic integration. It implies a time-dependent product-form result: For appropriate initial conditions, the queue lengths (numbers of customers in disjoint subsets of the state space) at any time are independent Poisson random variables. Even though there is no dependence among the queue lengths at each time, there is important dependence among the queue lengths at different times. We show that the joint distribution is multivariate Poisson, and calculate the covariances. A unified framework for constructing stochastic processes of interest is provided by stochastically integrating various functionals of the location process with respect to the Poisson arrival process. We use this approach to study the flows in the queueing network; e.g., we show that the aggregate arrival and departure processes at a given queue (to and from other queues as well as outside the network) are generalized Poisson processes (without necessarily having a rate or unit jumps) if and only if no customer can visit that queue more than once. We also characterize the aggregate arrival and departure processes when customers can visit the queues more frequently. In addition to obtaining structural results, we use the stochastic integrals to obtain explicit expressions for time-dependent means and covariances. We do this in two ways. First, we decompose the entire network into a superposition of independent networks with fixed deterministic routes. Second, we make Markov assumptions, initially for the evolution of the routes and finally for the entire location process. For Markov routing among the queues, the aggregate arrival rates are obtained as the solution to a system of input equations, which have a unique solution under appropriate qualifications, but not in general. Linear ordinary differential equations characterize the time-dependent means and covariances in the totally Markovian case.",1993,1993-03,13,3-Jan,183-250,"Massey, William A.

We assume that customers of different types arrive at a network and pass through the system via one of several possible routes; the set of routes available to a customer depends on its type. A route through the network is an ordered set of service stations: a customer queues for service at each station on its route and then leaves the system. The two methods of control we consider are the routing of customers through the network, and the sequencing of service at the stations, and our aim is to minimize the number of customers in the system. We concentrate especially on the insights which can be obtained from heavy traffic analysis, and in particular from Harrison's Brownian network models. Our main conclusion is that in many respects dynamic routingsimplifies the behaviour of networks, and that under good control policies it may well be possible to model the aggregate behaviour of a network quite straightforwardly.",1993,1993-03,13,3-Jan,47-86,"Kelly, F.

The first treatment corresponds to fixed up and down times and leads to a reflected Brownian motion, just as when there are no service interruptions, but with different parameters. To represent long rare interruptions, the second treatment has growing up and down times with the up and down times being of ordern and n1/2, respectively, when the traffic intensities are of order 1-n‚àí1/2. In this case we establish convergence in the Skorohod M1 topology to a multidimensional reflection of multidimensional Brownian motion plus a multidimensional jump process.",1993,1993-12,13,4,335-359,"Chen, Hong (University of British Columbia); Whitt, Ward (Nokia (United States))",University of British Columbia; Nokia (United States),36,1,3,161

10.1007/bf01158932,Queueing networks with dependent nodes and concurrent movements,"Classical queueing network processes are useful for modeling the movement of discrete units in a network in which the nodes operate independently, the routing of units is independent of the congestion, only one unit moves at a time and its equilibrium distribution is a well-understood product form. Actual networks, however, typically have dependent nodes and concurrent movement of units. Imagine the dependencies associated with the network movements of telephone calls, manufacturing material, computer data packets, messages in a parallel-processing simulation, etc. A second generation of queueing network processes is beginning to evolve for modeling such ‚Äúintelligent‚Äù networks with dependent nodes and concurrent movements. This paper describes the following fundamental processes that have been developed in this regard:‚Ä¢ A basic queueing network process for dependent nodes and single-unit movements. Examples include the classical Jackson, BCMP, Kelly and Kelly-Whittle networks and networks with interacting subpopulations.‚Ä¢ Reversible queueing network processes for dependent nodes and concurrent movements.

In this paper we consider a finite capacity queue in which arrivals are governed by a particular Markov renewal process, called a Markovian arrival process (MAP). With general service times and with the same type of service rule, we study this finite capacity queueing model in detail by obtaining explicit expressions for (a) the steady-state queue length densities at arrivals, at departures and at arbitrary time points, (b) the probability distributions of the busy period and the idle period of the server and (c) the Laplace-Stieltjes transform of the stationary waiting time distribution of an admitted customer at points of arrivals.

10.1007/bf01158934,A generalization of Norton's theorem for queueing networks,"A general framework for aggregation and decomposition of product form queueing networks with state dependent routing and servicing is presented. By analogy with electrical circuit theory, the stations are grouped into clusters of subnetworks such that the process decomposes into a global process and a local process. Moreover, the local process factorizes into the subnetworks. The global process and the local processes can be analyzed separately as if they were independent. The global process describes the behaviour of the queuing network in which each cluster is aggregated into a single station, whereas the local process describes the behaviour of the subnetworks as if they are not part of the queueing network. The decomposition and aggregation method formalized in this paper allows us to first analyze the global behaviour of the queueing network and subsequently analyze the local behaviour of the subnetworks of interest or to aggregate clusters into single stations without affecting the behaviour of the rest of the queueing network. Conditions are provided such that:- the global equilibrium distribution for aggregated clusters has a product form;- this form can be obtained by merely monitoring the global behaviour;- the computation of a detailed distribution, including its normalizing constant, can be decomposed into the computation of a global and a local distribution;- the marginal distribution for the number of jobs at the stations of a cluster can be obtained by merely solving local behaviour.As a special application, Norton's theorem for queueing networks is extended to queueing networks with state dependent routing such as due to capacity constraints at stations or at clusters of stations and state dependent servicing such as due to service delays for clusters of stations.",1993,1993-03,13,3-Jan,251-289,"Boucherie, Richard J.

The second limiting regime involves increasing the average lengths of the operative and inoperative periods, while keeping their ratio constant.

However, in that framework, the estimators often require the simulation of numerous additional sample subpaths, possibly making the technique practically infeasible in applications.

The walk times and the maximum number of services to be performed during each polling are dependent on the queue lengths of the stations. The main result is the derivation of the necessary and sufficient stability conditions of the system. Our approach is to map the multi-dimensional stability problem into many 1-dimensional stability problems through the concept of the least stable queue. The least stable queue is one that will become unstablefirst when the system load increases in some parameter region. The stability of the least stable queue thus implies stability of the system. The stability region for the whole system is then the union of the queue stability regions of all the least stable queues that are obtained through dominant systems and Loynes' theorem.

10.1007/bf01158960,Waiting-time tail probabilities in queues with long-tail service-time distributions,"We consider the standard GI/G/1 queue with unlimited waiting room and the first-in first-out service discipline. We investigate the steady-state waiting-time tail probabilities P(W>x) when the service-time distribution has a long-tail distribution, i.e., when the service-time distribution fails to have a finite moment generating function. We have developed algorithms for computing the waiting-time distribution by Laplace transform inversion when the Laplace transforms of the inter arrival-time and service-time distributions are known. One algorithm, exploiting Pollaczek's classical contourintegral representation of the Laplace transform, does not require that either of these transforms be rational. To facilitate such calculations, we introduce a convenient two-parameter family of long-tail distributions on the positive half line with explicit Laplace transforms. This family is a Pareto mixture of exponential (PME) distributions. These PME distributions have monotone densities and Pareto-like tails, i.e., are of orderx‚àír forr>1. We use this family of long-tail distributions to investigate the quality of approximations based on asymptotics for P(W>x) asx‚Üí‚àû. We show that the asymptotic approximations with these long-tail service-time distributions can be remarkably inaccurate for typical x values of interest. We also derive multi-term asymptotic expansions for the waiting-time tail probabilities in the M/G/1 queue. Even three terms of this expansion can be remarkably inaccurate for typicalx values of interest. Thus, we evidently must rely on numerical algorithms for determining the waiting-time tail probabilities in this case. When working with service-time data, we suggest using empirical Laplace transforms.",1994,1994-09,16,4-Mar,311-338,,Nokia (United States),84,3,,282

Customers arrive according to independent Poisson processes. The service times and the switchover times are independent with general distributions. The necessary and sufficient condition for the stability of such polling systems is established. The proof is based on the stochastic monotonicity of the state process at the polling instants. The stability of only a subset of the queues is also analyzed and, in case of heavy traffic, the order of explosion of the queues is given. The results are valid for a model with set-up times, and also when there is a local priority rule at the queues.",1994,1994-03,15,4-Jan,211-238,"Fricker, C.

The main tools for these results are the subadditive ergodic theorem, which is used to derive a strong law of large numbers, and basic theorems on monotone stochastic recursive sequences.

RCL was recognized as one of the fundamental principles to get relationships between time and embedded averages such as the extended Little's formulaH=ŒªG, but we show that it has other applications. For example, RCL is one of the important techniques for deriving equilibrium equations for stochastic processes. It is shown that the various techniques, including Mecke's formula for a stationary random measure, can be formulated as RCL. For this purpose, we start with a new definition of the rate with respect to a random measure, and generalize RCL by using it. We further introduce the notion of quasi-expectation, which is a certain extension of the ordinary expectation, and derive RCL applicable to the sample average results. It means that the sample average formulas such asH=ŒªG can be obtained as the stationary RCL in the quasi-expectation framework. We also survey several extensions of RCL and discuss examples.

If components arrive according to Poisson processes, we show that the output stream departing the kitting operation is a Markov renewal process. The distribution of time between kit completions is also derived.

10.1007/bf01189237,On modeling failure and repair times in stochastic models of manufacturing systems using generalized exponential distributions,"Failures of machines have a significant effect on the behavior of manufacturing systems. As a result it is important to model this phenomenon. Many queueing models of manufacturing systems do incorporate the unreliability of the machines. Most models assume that the times to failure and the times to repair of each machine are exponentially distributed (or geometrically distributed in the case of discrete-time models). However, exponential distributions do not always accurately represent actual distributions encountered in real manufacturing systems. In this paper, we propose to model failure and repair time distributions bygeneralized exponential (GE) distributions (orgeneralized geometric distributions in the case of a discretetime model). The GE distribution can be used to approximate distributions with any coefficient of variation greater than one. The main contribution of the paper is to show that queueing models in which failure and repair times are represented by GE distributions can be analyzed with the same complexity as if these distributions were exponential. Indeed, we show that failures and repair times represented by GE distributions can (under certain assumptions) be equivalently represented by exponential distributions.",1994,1994-03,15,4-Jan,199-209,"Dallery, Yves (Sorbonne University)",Sorbonne University,30,1,,326

This characterization leads to a unified proof for various stability results of open Jackson networks where service times are i.i.d. with a general distribution, external interarrivai times are i.i.d. with a general distribution and the routing is Bernoulli. We show that if the traffic condition is satisfied, i.e., the input rate is smaller than the service rate at each queue, then the queue length process (the number of customers at each queue) is tight. Under the traffic condition, the pth moment of the queue length process is bounded for allt if the p+lth moment of the service times at all queues are finite. If, furthermore, the moment generating functions of the service times at all queues exist, then all the moments of the queue length process are bounded for allt. When the interarrivai times are unbounded and non-lattice (resp. spreadout), the queue lengths and the remaining service times converge in distribution (resp. in total variation) to a steady state. Also, the moments converge if the corresponding moment conditions are satisfied.",1994,1994-03,15,4-Jan,239-260,"Chang, Cheng-Shang (IBM Research - Thomas J. Watson Research Center); Thomas, Joy A.

The problem is to control the arrival and service processes, and in particular to schedule the server in station 1 among the two job types, in order to minimize a discounted cost function over an infinite time horizon. Using a stochastic intensity control approach, we establish the optimality of a specific stationary policy, and show that its value function satisfies certain properties, which lead to a switching-curve structure. We further classify the problem into six parametric cases. Based on the structural properties of the stationary policy, we establish the optimality of some simple priority rules for three of the six cases, and develop heuristic policies for the other three cases.",1994,1994-09,18,4-Mar,301-332,"Chen, Hong (University of British Columbia); Yang, Ping (The University of Texas at Dallas); Yao, David D.

10.1007/bf01158765,A duality approach to admission and scheduling controls of queues,"This paper studies theadmission andscheduling control problem in an M/M/2 queueing system with nonidentical processors. Admission control renders when a newly arrived job should be accepted, whereas scheduling control determines when an available processor should be utilized. The system received a rewardR when a job completes its service and pays a unit holding costC while a job is in the system. The main goal of the paper is to obtain the admission/scheduling policy that maximizes the expected discounted and long-run average profits (reward minus cost). We convert the system into its dual, a stochastically identical system subject toexpulsion/scheduling control, and prove that the individually optimal policy in the dual system is socially optimal in the original system. In contrast with the dynamic programming (DP) technique which considers the system as a whole, we adopt the viewpoint of an individual job and analyze the impact of its behavior on the social outcome. The key properties which simplify the analysis are that under the individually optimal policy the profit of a job under the preemptive last-come first-priority service discipline (LCFP-P) is independent of jobs arrived earlier than itself and that the system is insensitive to service discipline imposed. The former makes possible to bypass complex dynamic programming analyses and the latter serves as a vehicle in connecting the social and individual optimality. We also exploit system operational characteristics under LCFP-P to obtain simple and close approximations of the optimal thresholds.",1994,1994-09,18,4-Mar,273-300,"Xu, Susan H.

After choosing their positions on the circle, according to a uniform distribution, they wait for a single server who travels on the circle. The server's movement is modelled by a Brownian motion with drift. Whenever the server encounters a customer, he stops and serves this customer. The service times are independent, but arbitrarily distributed. The model generalizes the continuous cyclic polling system (the diffusion coefficient of the Brownian motion is zero in this case) and can be interpreted as a continuous version of a Markov polling system. Using Tweedie's lemma for positive recurrence of Markov chains with general state space, we show that the system is stable if and only if the traffic intensity is less than one. Moreover, we derive a stochastic decomposition result which leads to equilibrium equations for the stationary configuration of customers on the circle.

We first note that the D-rule of ≈åsawa [11] is equivalent to the specific form for the release rate function, introduced in [7].

10.1007/bf01158694,Palm calculus for a process with a stationary random measure and its applications to fluid queues,"We consider a process associated with a stationary random measure, which may have infinitely many jumps in a finite interval. Such a process is a generalization of a process with a stationary embedded point process, and is applicable to fluid queues. Here, fluid queue means that customers are modeled as a continuous flow. Such models naturally arise in the study of high speed digital communication networks. We first derive the rate conservation law (RCL) for them, and then introduce a process indexed by the level of the accumulated input. This indexed process can be viewed as a continuous version of a customer characteristic of an ordinary queue, e.g., of the sojourn time. It is shown that the indexed process is stationary under a certain kind of Palm probability measure, called detailed Palm. By using this result, we consider the sojourn time processes in fluid queues. We derive the continuous version of Little's formula in our framework. We give a distributional relationship between the buffer content and the sojourn time in a fluid queue with a constant release rate.",1994,1994-03,17,2-Jan,183-211,"Miyazawa, Masakiyo (Tokyo University of Science)",Tokyo University of Science,13,0,,90

The key restrictions of the model are that the sources are independent, idle periods are exponentially distributed, and a source generates at least enough data during an active period to keep the server busy throughout the period. The exact formulas allow evaluation of the error in approximations such as a heavy traffic diffusion approximation.Both continuous and discrete time models are considered.

The mechanism of general blocking allows the server to process a limited number of jobs when the buffer downstream is full, and that of general starvation allows the server to perform a limited number of services in anticipation of jobs that are yet to arrive. The two main goals of this paper are to investigate how the throughput of cyclic GBS networks is affected by varying (1) the total number of jobsJ, and (2) the buffer allocationk=(k1..., km) subject to a fixed total buffer capacity K=k1 +... + km. In particular, we obtain sufficient conditions for the throughput to be symmetric inJ and to be maximized when J=K/2.

The basic idea starts with a heavy traffic approximation, but it is shown that the results are very good even when working far from the heavy traffic regime. The underlying numerical method is a version of what is known as the Markov chain approximation method. It is a powerful methodology for controlled and uncontrolled stochastic systems, which can be approximated by diffusion or reflected diffusion type systems, and has been used with success on many other problems in stochastic control. We give a complete development of the relevant details, with an emphasis on multiplexing and particular queueing systems. The approximating process is a controlled or uncontrolled Markov chain which retains certain essential features of the original problem. This problem is generally substantially simpler than the original physical problem, and there are associated convergence theorems. The non-classical associated ergodic cost problem is derived, and put into a form such that reliable and good numerical algorithms, based on multigrid type ideas, can be used.

10.1007/bf01158704,On performance comparison of MR/GI/1 queues,"In this paper we are interested in the effect that dependencies in the arrival process to a queue have on queueing properties such as mean queue length and mean waiting time. We start with a review of the well known relations used to compare random variables and random vectors, e.g., stochastic orderings, stochastic increasing convexity, and strong stochastic increasing concavity. These relations and others are used to compare interarrival times in Markov renewal processes first in the case where the interarrival time distributions depend only on the current state in the underlying Markov chain and then in the general case where these interarrivai times depend on both the current state and the next state in that chain. These results are used to study a problem previously considered by Patuwo et al. [14].Then, in order to keep the marginal distributions of the interarrivai times constant, we build a particular transition matrix for the underlying Markov chain depending on a single parameter,p. This Markov renewal process is used in the Patuwo et al. [14] problem so as to investigate the behavior of the mean queue length and mean waiting time on a correlation measure depending only onp. As constructed, the interarrival time distributions do not depend onp so that the effects we find depend only on correlation in the arrival process.As a result of this latter construction, we find that the mean queue length is always larger in the case where correlations are non-zero than they are in the more usual case of renewal arrivals (i.e., where the correlations are zero).

For two-state MMRPs and their superpositions we derive formulas for the distribution ofN(t) and its density. Further we give asymptotic results.

A second motivation comes from manufacturing, where due to cyclic scheduling of upstream machines, the arrival process to downstream machines is periodic. The model is a single server queue with FIFO service discipline and exponential interarrival and service times where the arrival and/or service rates are deterministic cyclic functions of the customer sequence number. We provide steady state results for the mean number in the system for the model with cyclic arrival and fixed service rates and for the model with fixed arrival and cyclic service rates.

The message delay is defined as the time elapsing between the arrival epoch of the first packet of the message to the system until after the transmission of the last packet of that message is completed. We distinguish between two types of message generation processes. The message can be generated as abatch or it can bedispersed over time. In this paper we focus on the dispersed generation model. The main difficulty in the analysis is due to the correlation between the system states observed by different packets of the same message. This paper introduces a new technique to analyze the message delay in such systems for different arrival models and different number of sessions. For an M/M/1 system with variable size messages and for the bursty traffic model, we obtain an explicit expression for the Laplace-Stieltjes transform (LST) of the message delay. Derivations are also provided for anM/G/1 system, for multiple session systems and for fixed message sizes. We show that the correlation has a strong effect on the performance of the system, and that the commonly usedindependence assumption, i.e., the assumption that the delays of packets are independent from packet to packet, can lead to wrong conclusions.",1994,1994-03,15,4-Jan,325-345,"Cidon, Israel (IBM Research - Thomas J.

Each job, after completing service in the last queue, is fed back (rerouted) to the first one, a random number of times, before leaving the system. The average execution time per job is exactly computed, as the number of jobs becomes large, and is minimized under mild conditions. The degree of parallelism achieved in the processing is also computed. The issue of rate-stability of the system is then considered. The network is defined to be rate-stable iff the job departure rate is equal to the job arrival rate; that depends heavily on the dynamic feedback policy we employ to place rerouted jobs in specific places of the front queue buffer of the network. The condition under which the network is rate-stable is specified, and a dynamic feedback policy is constructed, which rate-stabilizes the system under the maximum possible job arrival rate; thus, it maximizes the dynamic throughput of the network. Other related results concerning the performance of tandem networks with feedback are obtained.",1994,1994-03,15,4-Jan,137-164,"Bambos, Nicholas (University of California, Los Angeles); Wasserman, Kimberly (University of California, Los Angeles)","University of California, Los Angeles",2,0,,83

Our method features a stochastic decomposition, in which a major component of the delay is viewed as a discrete time queueing problem, where each window (selected by the channel access algorithm) becomes a customer requiring service in the form of conflict resolution. This technique is sufficiently powerful to give us the distribution of the packet delay in steady state. In this paper, we extend our method to allow the durations of elementary algorithmic steps to take on a general distribution (rather than being constants), which allows us to provide a unified treatment of channels with shared errors, some types of explicit reservation systems, and Local Area Networks with carrier sensing and/or collision detection, possibly in combination with variable size packets.",1994,1994-09,16,4-Mar,339-361,"Polyzos, George C.

We describe one approach whereby traffic sources can be modeled by chaotic maps, and illustrate the traffic characteristics that can be generated by analyzing several classes of maps. We outline a potential performance analysis approach based on chaotic maps that can be used to assess the traffic significance of fractal properties. We show that low order nonlinear maps can capture several of the fractal properties observed in actual data, and show that the source characteristics observed in actual traffic can lead to heavy-tailed queue length distributions. It is our conclusion that while there are considerable analytical difficulties, chaotic maps may allow accurate, yet concise, models of packet traffic, with some potential for transient and steady state analysis.",1995,1995-03,20,2-Jan,171-206,,Royal Institute of Technology,93,2,,183

We derive analytic formulas for the probability generating function of the number of customers in the system in steady-state. It is shown that the stochastic decomposition law holds for the Geo/G/1 retrial queue. Recursive formulas for the steady-state probabilities are developed. Computations based on these recursive formulas are numerically stable because the recursions involve only nonnegative terms. Since the regular Geo/G/1 queue is a special case of the Geo/G/1 retrial queue, the recursive formulas can also be used to compute the steady-state queue size distribution of the regular Geo/G/1 queue. Furthermore, it is shown that a continuous-time M/G/1 retrial queue can be approximated by a discrete-time Geo/G/1 retrial queue by dividing the time into small intervals of equal length and the approximation approaches the exact when the length of the interval tends to zero. This relationship allows us to apply the recursive formulas derived in this paper to compute the approximate steady-state queue size distribution of the continuous-time M/G/1 retrial queue and the regular M/G/1 queue.",1995,1995-03,21,2-Jan,199-215,"Yang, Tao (Technical University of Nova Scotia); Li, Hui (Mount Saint Vincent University)",Mount Saint Vincent University; Technical University of Nova Scotia,60,7,,138

The central idea is to characterize the region of achievable performance in a stochastic control problem, i.e., find linear or nonlinear constraints on the performance vectors that all policies satisfy. We present linear and nonlinear relaxations of the performance space for the following problems: Indexable systems (multiclass single station queues and multiarmed bandit problems), restless bandit problems, polling systems, multiclass queueing and loss networks. These relaxations lead to bounds on the performance of an optimal policy. Using information from the relaxations we construct heuristic nearly optimal policies. The theme in the paper is the thesis that better formulations lead to deeper understanding and better solution methods. Overall the proposed approach for stochastic control problems parallels efforts of the mathematical programming community in the last twenty years to develop sharper formulations (polyhedral combinatorics and more recently nonlinear relaxations) and leads to new insights ranging from a complete characterization and new algorithms for indexable systems to tight lower bounds and nearly optimal algorithms for restless bandit problems, polling systems, multiclass queueing and loss networks.",1995,1995-09,21,4-Mar,337-389,"Bertsimas, Dimitris (Massachusetts Institute of Technology)",Massachusetts Institute of Technology,33,5,,180
10.1007/bf01149169,Zero-sum Markov games and worst-case optimal control of queueing systems,"Zero-sum stochastic games model situations where two persons, called players, control some dynamic system, and both have opposite objectives. One player wishes typically to minimize a cost which has to be paid to the other player. Such a game may also be used to model problems with a single controller who has only partial information on the system: the dynamic of the system may depend on some parameter that is unknown to the controller, and may vary in time in an unpredictable way. A worst-case criterion may be considered, where the unknown parameter is assumed to be chosen by ‚Äúnature‚Äù (called player 1), and the objective of the controller (player 2) is then to design a policy that guarantees the best performance under worst-case behaviour of nature. The purpose of this paper is to present a survey of stochastic games in queues, where both tools and applications are considered. The first part is devoted to the tools. We present some existing tools for solving finite horizon and infinite horizon discounted Markov games with unbounded cost, and develop new ones that are typically applicable in queueing problems. We then present some new tools and theory of expected average cost stochastic games with unbounded cost. In the second part of the paper we present a survey on existing results on worst-case control of queues, and illustrate the structural properties of best policies of the controller, worst-case policies of nature, and of the value function.

10.1007/bf01148944,Relating polling models with zero and nonzero switchover times,"We consider a system of N queues served by a single server in cyclic order. Each queue has its own distinct Poisson arrival stream and its own distinct general service-time distribution (asymmetric queues), and each queue has its own distinct distribution of switchover time (the time required for the server to travel from that queue to the next). We consider two versions of this classical polling model: In the first, which we refer to as the zero-switchover-times model, it is assumed that all switchover times are zero and the server stops traveling whenever the system becomes empty. In the second, which we refer to as the nonzero-switchover-times model, it is assumed that the sum of all switchover times in a cycle is nonzero and the server does not stop traveling when the system is empty. After providing a new analysis for the zero-switchover-times model, we obtain, for a host of service disciplines, transform results that completely characterize the relationship between the waiting times in these two, operationally-different, polling models. These results can be used to derive simple relations that express (all) waiting-time moments in the nonzero-switchover-times model in terms of those in the zero-switchover-times model.

Our goal is to find general conditions, which are satisfied in a broad class of applications to control of queues, under which an optimal control policy is monotonic. An advantage of our approach is that it easily extends to problems with both information and action delays, which are common in applications to high-speed communication networks, among others. The transition probabilities are stochastically monotone and the one-stage reward submodular. We further assume that transitions from different states are coupled, in the sense that the state after a transition is distributed as a deterministic function of the current state and two random variables, one of which is controllable and the other uncontrollable. Finally, we make a monotonicity assumption about the sample-path effect of a pairwise switch of the actions in consecutive stages. Using induction on the horizon length, we demonstrate that optimal policies for the finite- and infinite-horizon discounted problems are monotonic. We apply these results to a single queueing facility with control of arrivals and/or services, under very general conditions. In this case, our results imply that an optimal control policy has threshold form. Finally, we show how monotonicity of an optimal policy extends in a natural way to problems with information and/or action delay, including delays of more than one time unit. Specifically, we show that, if a problem without delay satisfies our sufficient conditions for monotonicity of an optimal policy, then the same problem with information and/or action delay also has monotonic (e.g., threshold) optimal policies.",1995,1995-09,21,4-Mar,267-291,"Altman, Eitan (French Institute for Research in Computer Science and Automation); Stidham, Shaler (University of North Carolina System)",French Institute for Research in Computer Science and Automation; University of North Carolina System,24,2,,208

The control can occur in a variety of places; e.g., ‚Äúleaky bucket‚Äù controllers, control of ‚Äúmarked cells‚Äù at the transmitter buffer, or control of the transmitter speed. From the point of view of the limit equations, those are equivalent. Various forms of the optimal control problem are explored, where the main aim is to control or balance the losses at the control with those due to buffer overflow. It is shown that much can be saved via the use of optimal controls or reasonable approximations to them. We discuss systems with one to three classes of sources, various aggregation methods and control approximation schemes. There are qualitative comparisons of various systems with and without control and a discussion of the variations of control and performance as the systems data and control bounds vary.

Using simulation on some examples these heuristic policies are compared with traditional simple scheduling rules. The results show that the heuristic policies perform at least comparably to classical priority rules, regardless of the assumptions made about the traffic intensities and the arrival and service time distributions.

We consider a slotted time model where at each scheduling epoch the server (channel) is assigned to a particular class (transmission set) and can serve multiple customers (packets) simultaneously, one from every arrival stream (network node) that can belong to this class. The assignment is based on arandom polling policy: the current time slot is allocated to theith class with probability Œ∏i. Our objective is to determine the optimal probabilities by adjusting them on line so as to optimize some overall performance measure. We present an approach based on perturbation analysis techniques, where all customer arrival processes can be arbitrary, and no information about them is required. The basis of this approach is the development of two sensitivity estimators leading to amarked slot and aphantom slot algorithm. The algorithms determine the effect of removing/ adding service slots to an existing schedule on the mean customer waiting times by directly observing the system. The optimal slot assignment probabilities are then used to design adeterministic scheduling policy based on the Golden Ratio policy. Finally, several numerical results based on a simple optimization algorithm are included.",1995,1995-03,20,2-Jan,207-254,"Cassandras, Christos G.

The essential feature leading to the quasi-reversibility of these queues is the fact that the total departure rate in any queue state is independent of the order of the customers in the queue. We call such queues order independent (OI) queues. The OI class includes a significant part of Kelly's class of symmetric queues, although it does not cover the whole class. A distinguishing feature of the OI class is that, among others, it includes the MSCCC and MSHCC queues but not the LCFS queue. This demonstrates a certain generality of the class of OI queues and shows that the quasi-reversibility of the OI queues derives from causes other than symmetry principles. Finally, we examine OI queues where arrivals to the queue are lost when the number of customers in the queue equals an upper bound. We obtain the stationary distribution for the OI loss queue by normalizing the stationary probabilities of the corresponding OI queue without losses. A teletraffic application for the OI loss queue is presented.",1995,1995-12,19,4,345-359,"Berezner, S. A. (University of KwaZulu-Natal); Kriel, C. F. (Stellenbosch University); Krzesinski, A. E.

Such a model describes situations arising in high speed telecommunication systems, where information arrives in messages, each comprising a variable number of fixed-length packets, and it takes one unit of time (a slot) to transmit a packet. Since it is not desirable to attempt service when the system may be empty, we study a model where we assume that service is attempted only if, given the information available to the server, it is certain that there are messages in the queue. We characterize the probability distribution of the number of messages in the queue under some general stationarity assumptions on the arrival process, when information on the queue size is delayedK slots, and derive explicit expressions of the PGF of the queue length for the case of i.i.d. batch arrivals and general independent service times. We further derive the PGF of the queue size when information onboth the queue length and service completion is delayed K=1 units of time.

10.1007/bf01148940,Analyticity of single-server queues in light traffic,"Recently, several methods have been proposed to approximate performance measures of queueing systems based on their light traffic derivatives, e.g., the MacLaurin expansion, the Pad√© approximation, and interpolation with heavy traffic limits. The key condition required in all these approximations is that the performance measures be analytic when the arrival rates equal to zero. In this paper, we study theGI/G/1 queue. We show that if the c.d.f. of the interarrival time can be expressed as a MacLaurin series over [0, ‚àû), then the mean steady-state system time of a job is indeed analytic when the arrival rate to the queue equals to zero. This condition is satisfied by phase-type distributions but not c.d.f.'s without support [0, ‚àû), such as uniform and shifted exponential distributions. In fact, we show through two examples that the analyticity does not hold for most commonly used distribution functions which do not satisfy this condition.",1995,1995-03,19,2-Jan,63-80,"Hu, Jian-Qiang (Boston University)",Boston University,12,1,,40

10.1007/bf01158433,A new computational approach for stochastic fluid models of multiplexers with heterogeneous sources,"In this paper we derive an efficient computational procedure for the system in which fluid is produced by N1 on-off sources of type 1,N2 on-off sources of type 2 and transferred to a buffer which is serviced by a channel of constant capacity. This is a canonical model for multiservice ATM multiplexing, which is hard to analyze and also of wide interest. This paper's approach to the computation of the buffer overflow probability, G(x) = Pr{buffer content >x}, departs from all prior approaches in that it transforms the computation of G(x) for a particularx into a recursive construction of an interpolating polynomial. For the particular case of two source types the interpolating polynomial is in two variables. Our main result is the derivation of recursive algorithms for computing the overflow probability G(x) and various other performance measures using their respective relations to two-dimensional interpolating polynomials. To make the computational procedure efficient we first derive a new system of equations for the coefficients in the spectral expansion formula for G(x) and then use specific properties of the new system for efficient recursive construction of the polynomials. We also develop an approximate method with low complexity and analyze its accuracy by numerical studies. We compute G(x) for different values ofx, the mean buffer content and the coefficient of the dominant exponential term in the spectral expansion of G(x).

10.1007/bf01158435,Analysis of a statistical multiplexer with generalized periodic sources,"We provide solution techniques for the analysis of multiplexers with periodic arrival streams, which accurately account for the effects of active and idle periods and of gradual arrival. In the models considered in this paper, it is assumed that each source alternates (periodically) between active and idle periods of fixed durations. Incoming packets are transmitted on the network link and excess information is stored in the multiplexing buffer when the aggregate input rate exceeds the capacity of the link. We are interested in the probability distribution of the buffer content for a given network link speed as a function of the number of sources and their characteristics, i.e., rate and duration of idle and active periods. We derive this distribution from two models: discrete time and continuous time systems. Discrete time systems operate in a slotted fashion, with a slot defining the base unit for data generation and transmission. In particular, in each slot the link is capable of transmitting one data unit and conversely an active source generates one data unit in that time. The continuous time model of the paper falls in the category of fluid models. Compared to previous works we allow a more general model for the periodic packet arrival process of each source. In discrete time, this means that the active period of a source can now extend over several consecutive slots instead of a single slot as in previous models. In continuous time, packet arrivals are not required to be instantaneous, but rather the data generation process can now take place over the entire duration of the active period. In both cases, these generalizations allow us to account for the progressive arrival of source data as a function of both the source speed and the amount of data it generates in an active period.",1995,1995-03,20,2-Jan,139-169,,IBM Research - Thomas J.

Such models arise in data communication systems. The input is a Markov-compound Poisson process and the demand is a Markov linear process. The demand is satisfied if physically possible. We study the properties of the demand and its inverse, which may be viewed as transformed time clocks. We show that the unsatisfied demand is related to the infimum of the net input and that, under suitable conditions, it is an additive functional of the input process. The study of the storage level is based on a detailed analysis of the busy period, using techniques based on infinitesimal generators. The transform of the busy period is the unique solution of a certain matrix-functional equation. Steady state results are also obtained; these are not obvious generalizations of the results for simple storage models.

Such a ring network is commonly called ring withspatial reuse. It can achieve significantly higher throughput than standard token rings but it also raises the issue of fairness since some nodes may be prevented from accessing the ring for long time intervals. Policies that operate in cycles and guarantee that a certain number (quota) of packets will be transmitted by every node in every cycle have been considered before to deal with the fairness issue. In this paper we address the problem of designing a policy that results in a stable system whenever the end-to-end arrival rates are within the stability region of the ring with spatial reuse (the stability region of the ring is defined as the set of end-to-end arrival rates for which there is a policy that makes the ring stable). We provide such a policy, which does not require knowledge of end-to-end arrival rates. The policy is an adaptive version of the quota policies and can be implemented with the same distributed mechanism.

Writer and reader service times are general iid random variables. There is infinite waiting room for both. The alternating exhaustive priority policy operates as follows. Assume the system is initially idle. The first arriving customer initiates service for the class (readers or writers) to which it belongs. Once processing begins for a given class of customers, this class is served exhaustively, i.e. until no members of that class are left in the system. At this point, if customers of the other class are in the queue, priority switches to this class, and it is served exhaustively.

Using a new characterization of reversed hazard rate order, we show that if the service times for two servers are comparable in the reversed hazard rate sense, then the departure process is stochastically earlier if the slower server is first and the faster server is second than if the reverse is true. This strengthens earlier results that considered individual departure times marginally. We show similar results for the last two stages and for other blocking mechanisms.

The necessary and sufficient conditions for deadlockfree queueing networks with blocking are provided. An optimization algorithm is presented for finding deadlock-free capacity assignments with the least total capacity. The optimization algorithm maps the queueing network into a directed graph and obtains the deadlock freedom conditions from a specified subset of cycles in the directed graph. In certain network topologies, the number of deadlock freedom conditions can be large, thus, making any optimization computationally expensive. For a special class of topologies, so-calledtandem networks, it is shown that a minimal capacity assignment can be directly obtained without running an optimization algorithm.

10.1007/bf01158434,A comparison of the sliding window and the leaky bucket,"In this paper we compare the sliding-window (SW) and leaky-bucket (LB) input regulators. These regulators reject, or treat as lower priority, certain arrivals to a queueing system, so as to reduce congestion in the queueing system. Such regulators are currently of interest for access control in emerging high-speed communication networks. The SW admits no more than a specified numberW of arrivals in any interval of specified lengthL. The LB is a counter that increases by one up to a maximum capacityC for each arrival and decreases continuously at a given drain rate to as low as zero; an arrival is admitted if the counter is less than or equal to C‚àí1. To indirectly represent the impact of the regulator on the performance of the queueing system, we focus on the maximum bursts admissible at the peak rate. We show that the SW admits larger bursts than the LB at any given peak rate and admissible average rate. To make the comparison, we use a special construction: We start with a sample path of an arrival process with a given peak rate. We choose a window lengthL for the SW and find the minimum window contentW that is just conforming (so there are no rejections). We then set the LB drain rate equal to W/L, so that the two admissible average rates are identical. Finally, we choose the LB capacity C so that the given arrival process is also just conforming for the LB. With this construction, we show that the SW will admit larger bursts at the peak rate than the LB. We also develop approximations for these maximum burst sizes and their ratio over long time intervals based on extreme-value asymptotics. We use simulations to confirm that these approximations do indeed enable us to predict the burst ratios for typical stochastic arrival processes.",1995,1995-03,20,2-Jan,117-138,"Berger, Arthur W.

10.1007/bf01245326,Optimal buffer allocation in tandems of last come first served queues,"A large fixed number of buffer spaces is given. We consider the problem of allocating these spaces among the nodes of a tandem of last-come-first-served queues with general service time distributions and Poisson external arrivals so as to optimize some performance criterion associated with the time to buffer overflow, such as maximizing its mean or maximizing the probability that it exceeds some value. Consider the following rule of thumb: allocate the buffer spaces in inverse proportion to the logarithms of the effective service rates at the nodes. Here effective service rate denotes the ratio of the service rate to the stationary arrival rate. We prove that this rule of thumb achieves a nearly optimal buffer allocation under the assumption that the service time distributions satisfy an exponential tail condition. This problem has been studied earlier in the context of Jackson networks, where it was shown that the same rule of thumb achieves an allocation that is close to optimal. The technique of proof here is similar, but there are important differences. Both Jackson networks and the LCFS tandems considered here are product form networks (with infinite buffers). Optimism should lead us to expect that the near optimality of this rule of thumb holds much more generally for product-form networks, but this remains a conjecture at present.",1995,1995-09,20,4-Mar,395-407,"Anantharam, V.

An important goal is to formulate general criteria for when such networks possess equilibria, and to characterize these equilibria when possible. Fluid models have recently become an important tool for such purposes. We are interested here in a family of such models, FIFO fluid models of Kelly type. That is, the discipline is first-in, first-out, and the service rate depends only on the station. To study such models, we introduce an entropy function associated with the state of the system. The corresponding estimates show that if the traffic intensity function is at most 1, then such fluid models converge exponentially fast to equilibria with fixed concentrations of customer types throughout each queue. When the traffic intensity function is strictly less than 1, the limit is always the empty state and occurs after a finite time.

We show that the stationary buffer content in this model can be easily analysed by looking at embedded time points.

The main part of the paper is devoted to analyzing a problem of an admission and a service (vacation) control. The admission controller has to decide whether to allow arrivals to occur. Once the queue empties, the server goes on vacation, and controls the vacations duration (according to the state and past history of the queue). The immediate costs for each controller are increasing in the number of customers, but no convexity assumptions are made. The controllers are shown to have a stationary equilibrium policy pair, for which each controller uses a stationary threshold type policy with randomization in at most one state. We then investigate a problem of a non-zero sum stochastic game between a router into several queues, and a second controller that allocates some extra service capacity to one of the queues. We establish the equilibrium of a policy pair for which the router uses the intuitive ‚ÄúJoin the shortest queue‚Äù policy.",1996,1996-03,23,4-Jan,259-279,"Altman, Eitan (French Institute for Research in Computer Science and Automation)",French Institute for Research in Computer Science and Automation,29,0,,131

10.1007/bf01149175,A new class of performance results for a fractional Brownian traffic model,"Recent Bellcore studies have shown that high-speed data traffic exhibits ‚Äúlong-range dependence‚Äù, characterized byH>0.5, whereH is the Hurst parameter of the traffic. In the wake of those studies, there has been much interest in developing tractable analytical models for traffic with long-range dependence, for use in performance evaluation and traffic engineering. Norros has used a traffic model known as Fractional Brownian Motion (FBM) to derive several analytical results on the behavior of a queue subject to such an arrival process. In this paper, we derive a new class of results, also based on the FBM model, which reveal rather curious and unexpected ‚Äúcrossover‚Äù properties of the Hurst parameter of the traffic, as regards its effect on the behavior of queues. These results, together with those of Norros, serve to enhance our understanding of the significance of the Hurst parameterH for traffic engineering. In particular, Krishnan and Meempat have used the crossover property derived here to explain, in part, a gap that existed between the results of two sets of Bellcore studies, one casting doubt on the usefulness of Markovian traffic models and methods whenH>0.5, and the other furnishing an example of successful traffic engineering with Markovian methods for traffic known to haveH>0.5. The results derived here can be used to obtainconservative estimates of the multiplexing gains achieved when independent traffic sources with the same Hurst parameterH are multiplexed for combined transmission. In turn, such estimates yield guidelines for the engineering of ATM links that are subject to traffic with long-range dependence.",1996,1996-09,22,4-Mar,277-285,,,25,0,,48

The approach involves deriving necessary and sufficient conditions on the paths of the arrival and virtual service processes in order to get a large queue size at the second queue. We then use large deviations estimates of the probabilities of these paths, and solve a constrained convex optimization problem to find the most likely path leading to a large queue size.

In ATM networks, packets are of fixed length and the buffering memory in switching nodes is limited to a finite numberK of cells. These motivate us to study the MAP/D/1/K queue. We present an algorithm to compute the stationary virtual waiting time distribution for the MAP/D/1/K queue via rational approximations for the deterministic service time distribution in transform domain. These approximations include the well-known Erlang distributions and the Pad√© approximations that we propose. Using these approximations, the solution for the queueing system is shown to reduce to the solution of a linear differential equation with suitable boundary conditions.

10.1007/bf01206554,Exact analysis of asymmetric random polling systems with single buffers and correlated input process,"We introduce a simple approach for modeling and analyzing asymmetric random polling systems with single buffers and correlated input process. We consider two variations of single buffers system: the conventional system and the buffer relaxation system. In the conventional system, at most one customer may be resided in any queue at any time. In the buffer relaxation system, a buffer becomes available to new customers as soon as the current customer is being served. Previous studies concentrate on conventional single buffer system with independent Poisson process input process. It has been shown that the asymmetric system requires the solution ofm 2m‚àí1) linear equations; and the symmetric system requires the solution of 2m‚àí1‚àí1 linear equations, wherem is the number of stations in the system. For both the conventional system and the buffer relaxation system, we give the exact solution to the more general case and show that our analysis requires the solution of 2m‚àí1 linear equations. For the symmetric case, we obtain explicit expressions for several performance measures of the system. These performance measures include the mean and second moment of the cycle time, loss probability, throughput, and the expected delay observed by a customer.",1996,1996-03,23,4-Jan,131-156,"Lee, Thomas Yew Sing (University of Illinois at Chicago); Sunjaya, Jan (University of Illinois at Chicago)",University of Illinois at Chicago,8,0,,61
10.1007/bf01149179,Analysis of preemptive loss priority queues with preemption distance,"In a queueing system with preemptive loss priority discipline, customers disappear from the system immediately when their service is preempted by the arrival of another customer with higher priority. Such a system can model a case in which old requests of low priority are not worthy of deferred service. This paper is concerned with preemptive loss priority queues in which customers of each priority class arrive in a Poisson process and have general service time distribution. The strict preemption in the existing model is extended by allowing the preemption distance parameterd such that arriving customers of only class 1 throughp ‚Äî d can preempt the service of a customer of classp. We obtain closed-form expressions for the mean waiting time, sojourn time, and queue size from their distributions for each class, together with numerical examples.

10.1007/bf01149174,Higher order approximations for tandem queueing networks,"In this paper a higher order approximation for single server queues and tandem queueing networks is proposed and studied. Different from the most popular two-moment based approximations in the literature, the higher order approximation uses the higher moments of the interarrival and service distributions in evaluating the performance measures for queueing networks. It is built upon the MacLaurin series analysis, a method that is recently developed to analyze single-node queues, along with the idea of decomposition using higher orders of the moments matched to a distribution. The approximation is computationally flexible in that it can use as many moments of the interarrival and service distributions as desired and produce the corresponding moments for the waiting and interdeparture times. Therefore it can also be used to study several interesting issues that arise in the study of queueing network approximations, such as the effects of higher moments and correlations. Numerical results for single server queues and tandem queueing networks show that this approximation is better than the two-moment based approximations in most cases.",1996,1996-09,22,4-Mar,249-276,"Girish, Muckai K.

Environmental processes cause interruptions in the input and/or output processes of the discrete storage processes. Due to the difficulties encountered in the exact analysis of such discrete storage systems, often Poisson flow and/or fluid flow models with the same modulating environmental processes are proposed as approximations for these systems. The analysis of Poisson flow and fluid flow models is much easier than that of the discrete storage processes. In this paper we give sufficient conditions under which the content of the discrete storage processes can be bounded by the Poisson flow and the fluid flow models. For example, we show that Poisson flow models and the fluid flow models developed by Kosten (and by Anick, Mitra and Sondhi) can be used to bound the performance of infinite (finite) source packetized voice/data communication systems. We also show that a Poisson flow model and the fluid flow model developed by Mitra can be used to bound the buffer content of a two stage automatic transfer line.

We formulate a semi-Markov decision program with a long-run average objective, and derive the stationary optimal policy to control and coordinate the production, inspection, and idling processes.

Such a model has potential application to automated manufacturing systems or packet-switched communication networks, where a message is divided into packets (or cells) of fixed lengths. The network is a series-type assembly or transfer line, with the exception that there is an additional class of jobs that requires processing only at the first node (class 0). There is a holding cost per unit time that is proportional to the total number of customers in the system. The objective is to minimize the (expected) total discounted holding cost over a finite or an infinite horizon. We show that an optimal policy gives priority to class-0 jobs at node 1 when at least one of a set ofm‚àí1 inequalities on partial sums of the components of the state vector is satisfied. We solve the problem by two methods. The first involves formulating the problem as a (discrete-time) Markov decision process and using induction on the horizon length.

This problem may be represented as a random walk on the integer grid in the first quadrant of the plane. An important aspect of the random walk is that it is possible to make large jumps in the direction of the boundaries. This feature gives rise to complicated boundary behavior. Generating function approaches to analyze this type of random walk seem to be extremely complicated and have not been successful yet. The approach presented in this paper directly solves the equilibrium equations. It is shown that the equilibrium distribution of the random walk can be written as an infinite linear combination of products. This linear combination is constructed in a compensation procedure. The starting solutions for this procedure are found by solving the shortest expected delay problem with instantaneous jockeying. The results can be used for an efficient computation of performance criteria, such as the waiting time distribution and the moments of the waiting time and the queue lengths.",1996,1996-03,23,4-Jan,77-105,"Adan, Ivo (Eindhoven University of Technology); Wessels, Jaap (Eindhoven University of Technology)",Eindhoven University of Technology,5,0,,75

The derivation of error bounds is based on an idea by Olver applicable to integral transforms with an exponentially decaying kernel. The bounds are expressed in terms of the supremum of a certain function and are asymptotic to the absolute value of the first neglected term in the expansion as the large parameter approaches infinity.

The study is directed toward identifying the worst traffic of arrivals allowed by the leaky-bucket regulation and clarifying the effects of the leaky bucket parameters (which represent the arrival rate and burstiness) on the average queueing delay. The arrival traffic that maximizes the average queueing delay is characterized as the repetition of the following three phases: bulky arrival, greedy arrival for a specified length of interval, and then no arrival till the token bucket is full.

On their arrival, customers are either routed to their normal server or are rerouted to the alternate server. We model the extra work for rerouted customers by assuming that each rerouted customer generates several tasks for the alternate server. This model can become non-ergodic even when the total arrival rate is smaller than the total service rate in the system.

However, the space and service requirements of different customers are assumed to be independent. Each customer occupies its space requirement in a buffer until it has completely received its service, at which time, it relinquishes the space it occupied. We study and solve the problem of finding the steady-state distribution of the total space requirement of all customers present in the system. In the process of doing so, we also generalize the solution of the MAP/G/1 queue and find the time-average joint distribution of the queue-length, the state of the arrival process and the elapsed service time, conditioned on the server being busy.

Over a certain range of passenger arrival rates, the average round trip time of an elevator can be approximated by a linear function of the number of passengers carried which, in turn, is proportional to the time since the last elevator departure from the lobby (the headway). A pair of deterministic equations for the means of two state variables describes the approximate evolution of the system behavior. These equations lead to a very strange chaotic type of motion in the two-dimensional state space. For moderately light traffic the two elevators tend to travel close together, but for heavy traffic the headways tend to be nearly uniformly distributed over the mean round trip time of a single elevator.",1996,1996-03,23,4-Jan,57-76,"Newell, G.

10.1023/a:1019104402024,Asymptotics for M/G/1 low-priority waiting-time tail probabilities,"We consider the classical M/G/1 queue with two priority classes and the nonpreemptive and preemptive-resume disciplines. We show that the low-priority steady-state waiting-time can be expressed as a geometric random sum of i.i.d. random variables, just like the M/G/1 FIFO waiting-time distribution. We exploit this structures to determine the asymptotic behavior of the tail probabilities. Unlike the FIFO case, there is routinely a region of the parameters such that the tail probabilities have non-exponential asymptotics. This phenomenon even occurs when both service-time distributions are exponential. When non-exponential asymptotics holds, the asymptotic form tends to be determined by the non-exponential asymptotics for the high-priority busy-period distribution. We obtain asymptotic expansions for the low-priority waiting-time distribution by obtaining an asymptotic expansion for the busy-period transform from Kendall's functional equation. We identify the boundary between the exponential and non-exponential asymptotic regions. For the special cases of an exponential high-priority service-time distribution and of common general service-time distributions, we obtain convenient explicit forms for the low-priority waiting-time transform. We also establish asymptotic results for cases with long-tail service-time distributions. As with FIFO, the exponential asymptotics tend to provide excellent approximations, while the non-exponential asymptotics do not, but the asymptotic relations indicate the general form. In all cases, exact results can be obtained by numerically inverting the waiting-time transform.",1997,1997-06,25,4-Jan,173-233,"Abate, Joseph (); Whitt, Ward ()",,108,3,,274

Such queues arise naturally in computer and communication problems in which customers belong to different classes and share a common server under some complicated service discipline. In such queues, the viewpoint of a given class of customers is that the server is not available for providing service some of the time, because it is busy serving customers from a different class. A natural special case of these queues is the class of preemptive priority queues. In this paper, we consider arrivals according the Markovian Arrival Process (MAP) and the server is not available for service at certain times. The service times are assumed to have a general distribution. We provide numerical examples to show that our methods are computationally feasible.",1997,1997-11,26,4-Mar,285-300,"Takine, Tetsuya (Osaka University); Sengupta, Bhaskar (NEC Corporation of America)",NEC Corporation of America; Osaka University,57,8,,313

Two different holding costs for stages 1 and 2 and different switching costs from one stage to the other are considered. We show that the optimal policy in the second stage is greedy; and if the holding cost rate in the second stage is greater or equal to the rate in the first stage, then the optimal policy in the second stage is also exhaustive. Then, the optimality condition for sequential service policy in systems with zero switchover times is introduced. Considering some properties of the optimal policy, we then define a Triple-Threshold (TT) policy to approximate the optimal policy in the first stage. Finally, a model is introduced to find the optimal TT policy, and using numerical results, it is shown that the TT policy accurately approximates the optimal policy.",1997,1997-11,26,4-Mar,203-228,"Iravani, S.M.R.

10.1023/a:1019108502933,A heavy-traffic analysis of a closed queueing system with a GI/‚àû service center,"This paper studies the heavy-traffic behavior of a closed system consisting of two service stations. The first station is an infinite server and the second is a single server whose service rate depends on the size of the queue at the station. We consider the regime when both the number of customers, n, and the service rate at the single-server station go to infinity while the service rate at the infinite-server station is held fixed. We show that, as n‚Üí‚àû, the process of the number of customers at the infinite-server station normalized by n converges in probability to a deterministic function satisfying a Volterra integral equation. The deviations of the normalized queue from its deterministic limit multiplied by ‚àön converge in distribution to the solution of a stochastic Volterra equation. The proof uses a new approach to studying infinite-server queues in heavy traffic whose main novelty is to express the number of customers at the infinite server as a time-space integral with respect to a time-changed sequential empirical process. This gives a new insight into the structure of the limit processes and makes the end results easy to interpret. Also the approach allows us to give a version of the classical heavy-traffic limit theorem for the G/GI/ ‚àû queue which, in particular, reconciles the limits obtained earlier by Iglehart and Borovkov.",1997,1997-06,25,4-Jan,235-280,"Krichagina, E.V.

Here we begin the analysis of the large buffer asymptotics for a multiplexer driven by this class of inputs. To do so we rely on recent results by Duffield and O‚ÄôConnell on overflow probabilities for the general single server queue. In this paper we focus on the key step in this approach: The appropriate large deviations scaling is shown to be related to the forward recurrence time of the service time distribution, and a closed form expression is derived for the corresponding generalized limiting log-moment generating function associated with the input process. Three different regimes are identified. In a companion paper we apply these results to obtain the large buffer asymptotics under a variety of service time distributions.",1997,1997-04,27,4-Mar,271-296,"Parulekar, Minothi (University of Maryland, College Park); Makowski, Armand M.

10.1023/a:1019100301115,Transient laws of non-stationary queueing systems and their applications,"In this paper we consider the general class of non-stationary queueing models and identify structural relationships between the number of customers in the system and the delay at time t, denoted by L(t) and S(t), respectively. In particular, we first establish a transient Little's law at the same level of generality as the classical stationary version of Little's law. We then obtain transient distributional laws for overtake free non-stationary systems. These laws relate the distributions of L(t) and S(t) and constitute a complete set of equations that describes the dynamics of overtake free non-stationary queueing systems. We further extend these laws to multiclass systems as well. Finally, to demonstrate the power of the transient laws we apply them to a variety queueing systems: Infinite and single server systems with non-stationary Poisson arrivals and general non-stationary services, multiclass single server systems with general non-stationary arrivals and services, and multiserver systems with renewal arrivals and deterministic services, operating in the transient domain. For all specific systems we relate the performance measures using the established set of laws and obtain a complete description of the system in the sense that we have a sufficient number of integral equations and unknowns. We then solve the set of integral equations using asymptotic expansions and exact numerical techniques. We also report computational results from our methods.",1997,1997-06,25,4-Jan,115-155,"Bertsimas, Dimitris (); Mourtzinou, Georgia ()",,39,2,1,284
10.1023/a:1019156418862,Peak congestion in multi-server service systems with slowly varying arrival rates,"In this paper we consider the Mt queueing model with infinitely many servers and a nonhomogeneous Poisson arrival process. Our goal is to obtain useful insights and formulas for nonstationary finite-server systems that commonly arise in practice. Here we are primarily concerned with the peak congestion. For the infinite-server model, we focus on the maximum value of the mean number of busy servers and the time lag between when this maximum occurs and the time that the maximum arrival rate occurs. We describe the asymptotic behavior of these quantities as the arrival changes more slowly, obtaining refinements of previous simple approximations. In addition to providing improved approximations, these refinements indicate when the simple approximations should perform well. We obtain an approximate time-dependent distribution for the number of customers in service in associated finite-server models by using the modified-offered-load (MOL) approximation, which is the finite-server steady-state distribution with the infinite-server mean serving as the offered load. We compare the value and lag in peak congestion predicted by the MOL approximation with exact values for Mt/M/s delay models with sinusoidal arrival-rate functions obtained by numerically solving the Chapman‚ÄìKolmogorov forward equations. The MOL approximation is remarkably accurate when the delay probability is suitably small. To treat systems with slowly varying arrival rates, we suggest focusing on the form of the arrival-rate function near its peak, in particular, on its second and third derivatives at the peak. We suggest estimating these derivatives from data by fitting a quadratic or cubic polynomial in a suitable interval about the peak.",1997,1997-06,25,4-Jan,157-172,"Massey, William A.

The parameters are the traffic intensities of the different classes. An unusual condition of stability is obtained thanks to a new argument based on the characterization of the ‚Äúessential states‚Äù. The exact stability conditions are then detected thanks to an associated fluid network: we identify a zone of the parameter space in which diverging, fluid paths appear. In order to show that this is a zone of instability (and that the network is stable outside this zone), we resort to the criteria of ergodicity and transience proved by Malyshev and Menshikov for reflected random walks in Z6+ (Malyshev and Menshikov, 1981). Their approach allows us to neglect some ‚Äúpathological‚Äù fluid paths that perturb the dynamics of the fluid model.

10.1023/a:1019168821588,Control and recovery from rare congestion events in a large multi-server system,"We develop deterministic fluid approximations to describe the recovery from rare congestion events in a large multi-server system in which customer holding times have a general distribution. There are two cases, depending on whether or not we exploit the age distribution (the distribution of elapsed holding times of customers in service). If we do not exploit the age distribution, then the rare congestion event is a large number of customers present. If we do exploit the age distribution, then the rare event is an unusual age distribution, possibly accompanied by a large number of customers present. As an approximation, we represent the large multi-server system as an M/G/‚àû model. We prove that, under regularity conditions, the fluid approximations are asymptotically correct as the arrival rate increases. The fluid approximations show the impact upon the recovery time of the holding-time distribution beyond its mean. The recovery time may or not be affected by the holding-time distribution having a long tail, depending on the precise definition of recovery. The fluid approximations can be used to analyze various overload control schemes, such as reducing the arrival rate or interrupting services in progress. We also establish large deviations principles to show that the two kinds of rare events have the same exponentially small order. We give numerical examples showing the effect of the holding-time distribution and the age distribution, focusing especially on the consequences of long-tail distributions.",1997,1997-10,26,2-Jan,69-104,"Duffield, N.G.

10.1023/a:1019193527040,On the stability of retrial queues,"We consider the following Type of problems. Calls arrive at a queue of capacity K (which is called the primary queue), and attempt to get served by a single server. If upon arrival, the queue is full and the server is busy, the new arriving call moves into an infinite capacity orbit, from which it makes new attempts to reach the primary queue, until it finds it non-full (or it finds the server idle). If the queue is not full upon arrival, then the call (customer) waits in line, and will be served according to the FIFO order. If Œª is the arrival rate (average number per time unit) of calls and Œº is one over the expected service time in the facility, it is well known that Œº > Œª is not always sufficient for stability. The aim of this paper is to provide general conditions under which it is a sufficient condition. In particular, (i) we derive conditions for Harris ergodicity and obtain bounds for the rate of convergence to the steady state and large deviations results, in the case that the inter-arrival times, retrial times and service times are independent i.i.d. sequences and the retrial times are exponentially distributed; (ii) we establish conditions for strong coupling convergence to a stationary regime when either service times are general stationary ergodic (no independence assumption), and inter-arrival and retrial times are i.i.d. exponentially distributed; or when inter-arrival times are general stationary ergodic, and service and retrial times are i.i.d. exponentially distributed; (iii) we obtain conditions for the existence of uniform exponential bounds of the queue length process under some rather broad conditions on the retrial process.

For this class of models, which contains models with exhaustive and gated service as special cases, we obtain closed-form expressions for the expected delay under standard heavy-traffic scalings. We identify a single parameter associated with the service discipline at each queue, which we call the ‚Äòexhaustiveness‚Äô. We show that the scaled expected delay figures depend on the service policies at the queues only through the exhaustiveness of each of the service disciplines. This implies that the influence of different service disciplines, but with the same exhaustiveness, on the expected delays at the queues becomes the same when the system reaches saturation. This observation leads to a new classification of the service disciplines. In addition, we show monotonicity of the scaled expected delays with respect to the exhaustiveness of the service disciplines. This induces a complete ordering in terms of efficiency of the service disciplines. The results also lead to new rules for optimization of the system performance with respect to the service disciplines at the queues. Further, the exact asymptotic results suggest simple expected waiting-time approximations for polling models in heavy traffic. Numerical experiments show that the accuracy of the approximations is excellent for practical heavy-traffic scenarios.",1997,1997-04,27,4-Mar,227-250,"van der Mei, R.D.

The notion is useful to derive a traffic equation. We also introduce a multi-source model, which means that there are different types of outside sources, to capture a wider range of applications.

The problem is motivated, in particular, by recent advances in high-speed networking where information delays have become prominent. We formulate the problem in the framework of Completely Observable Controlled Markov Chains, in terms of a multi-dimensional state variable. Exploiting the structure of the problem, we show that under appropriate conditions, the multi-dimensional Dynamic Programming Equation (DPE) can be reduced to a unidimensional one. We then provide simple computable upper and lower bounds to the optimal value function corresponding to the reduced unidimensional DPE. These upper and lower bounds, along with a certain relationship among the parameters of the problem, enable us to deduce partially the structural features of the optimal policy. Our approach enables us to recover simply, in part, the recent results of Altman and Stidham, who have shown that a multiple-threshold-type policy is optimal for this problem. Further, under the same relationship among the parameters of the problem, we provide easily computable upper bounds to the multiple thresholds and show the existence of simple relationships among these upper bounds.

Many approximations used in queueing theory have been drawn from the behavior of queues in light and heavy traffic conditions. In this paper, we propose a new approximation technique, which combines the light and heavy traffic characteristics. This interpolation approximation is based on the theory of multipoint Pad√© approximation which is applied at two points: light and heavy traffic. We show how this can be applied for estimating the waiting time moments of the GI/G/1 queue. The light traffic derivatives of any order can be evaluated using the MacLaurin series analysis procedure. The heavy traffic limits of the GI/G/1 queue are well known in the literature. Our technique generalizes the previously developed interpolation approximations and can be used to approximate any order of the waiting time moments. Through numerical examples, we show that the moments of the steady state waiting time can be estimated with extremely high accuracy under all ranges of traffic intensities using low orders of the approximant.

Larson (1990) introduced the QIE. His objective was to deduce the behavior of a multiserver queueing system without observing the queue. With only a Poisson arrival assumption, he analyzed the performance during a busy period. Such a period starts once all servers are busy with the queue empty, and it ends as soon as a server becomes idle. We generalize the standard order statistics result for Poisson processes, and show how to sample a busy period in the M/M/c system. We derive simple expressions for the variance of the total waiting time in the M/M/c and M/D/1 queues given that n Poisson arrivals and departures occur during a busy period. We also perform a probabilistic analysis of the EDD for a one-machine scheduling problem with earliness and tardiness penalties. The schedule is without preemption and with no inserted idle time. The jobs are independent and each may have a different due date. For large n, we show that the variance of the total penalty costs of the EDD is linear in n. The mean of the total penalty costs of the EDD is known to be proportional to the square root of n (see Harel (1993)).",1997,1997-04,27,4-Mar,325-350,"Harel, Arie (University of Toronto); Cheng, Hilary (Yuan Ze University)",Yuan Ze University; University of Toronto,1,1,,93
10.1023/a:1019170216562,Branching/queueing networks: Their introduction and near-decomposability asymptotics,"A new class of models, which combines closed queueing networks with branching processes, is introduced. The motivation comes from MIMD computers and other service systems in which the arrival of new work is always triggered by the completion of former work, and the amount of arriving work is variable. In the variant of branching/queueing networks studied here, a customer branches into a random and state-independent number of offspring upon completing its service. The process regenerates whenever the population becomes extinct. Implications for less rudimentary variants are discussed. The ergodicity of the network and several other aspects are related to the expected total number of progeny of an associated multitype Galton-Watson process. We give a formula for that expected number of progeny. The objects of main interest are the stationary state distribution and the throughputs. Closed-form solutions are available for the multi-server single-node model, and for homogeneous networks of infinite-servers. Generally, branching/queueing networks do not seem to have a product-form state distribution. We propose a conditional product-form approximation, and show that it is approached as a limit by branching/queueing networks with a slowly varying population size.

10.1023/a:1019160803783,State space collapse with application to heavy traffic limits for multiclass queueing networks,"Heavy traffic limits for multiclass queueing networks are a topic of continuing interest. Presently, the class of networks for which these limits have been rigorously derived is restricted. An important ingredient in such work is the demonstration of state space collapse. Here, we demonstrate state space collapse for two families of networks, first-in first-out (FIFO) queueing networks of Kelly type and head-of-the-line proportional processor sharing (HLPPS) queueing networks. We then apply our techniques to more general networks. To demonstrate state space collapse for FIFO networks of Kelly type and HLPPS networks, we employ law of large number estimates to show a form of compactness for appropriately scaled solutions. The limits of these solutions are next shown to satisfy fluid model equations corresponding to the above queueing networks. Results from Bramson [4,5] on the asymptotic behavior of these limits then imply state space collapse. The desired heavy traffic limits for FIFO networks of Kelly type and HLPPS networks follow from this and the general criteria set forth in the companion paper Williams [41]. State space collapse and the ensuing heavy traffic limits also hold for more general queueing networks, provided the solutions of their fluid model equations converge. Partial results are given for such networks, which include the static priority disciplines.",1998,1998-11,30,2-Jan,89-140,"Bramson, Maury (University of Minnesota)",University of Minnesota,184,19,,729
10.1023/a:1019112920622,Strong approximations for Markovian service networks,"Inspired by service systems such as telephone call centers, we develop limit theorems for a large class of stochastic service network models. They are a special family of nonstationary Markov processes where parameters like arrival and service rates, routing topologies for the network, and the number of servers at a given node are all functions of time as well as the current state of the system. Included in our modeling framework are networks of Mt/Mt/nt queues with abandonment and retrials. The asymptotic limiting regime that we explore for these networks has a natural interpretation of scaling up the number of servers in response to a similar scaling up of the arrival rate for the customers. The individual service rates, however, are not scaled. We employ the theory of strong approximations to obtain functional strong laws of large numbers and functional central limit theorems for these networks. This gives us a tractable set of network fluid and diffusion approximations. A common theme for service network models with features like many servers, priorities, or abandonment is ‚Äúnon-smooth‚Äù state dependence that has not been covered systematically by previous work. We prove our central limit theorems in the presence of this non-smoothness by using a new notion of derivative.",1998,1998-11,30,2-Jan,149-201,,Technion ‚Äì Israel Institute of Technology,176,22,,525
10.1023/a:1019108819713,Diffusion approximations for open multiclass queueing networks: sufficient conditions involving state space collapse,"Certain diffusion processes known as semimartingale reflecting Brownian motions (SRBMs) have been shown to approximate many single class and some multiclass open queueing networks under conditions of heavy traffic. While it is known that not all multiclass networks with feedback can be approximated in heavy traffic by SRBMs, one of the outstanding challenges in contemporary research on queueing networks is to identify broad categories of networks that can be so approximated and to prove a heavy traffic limit theorem justifying the approximation. In this paper, general sufficient conditions are given under which a heavy traffic limit theorem holds for open multiclass queueing networks with head-of-the-line (HL) service disciplines, which, in particular, require that service within each class is on a first-in-first-out (FIFO) basis. The two main conditions that need to be verified are that (a) the reflection matrix for the SRBM is well defined and completely- S, and (b) a form of state space collapse holds. A result of Dai and Harrison shows that condition (a) holds for FIFO networks of Kelly type and their proof is extended here to cover networks with the HLPPS (head-of-the-line proportional processor sharing) service discipline. In a companion work, Bramson shows that a multiplicative form of state space collapse holds for these two families of networks.

This perturbation result is called an invariance principle by analogy with the invariance principle of Stroock and Varadhan for diffusions with boundary conditions. A crucial ingredient in the proof of this result is an oscillation inequality for solutions of a perturbed Skorokhod problem.

This method is supported both by physical reasoning and by experimental evidence. We exhibit the long-range dependence of such a process and, by studying its second-order properties, we asymptotically match its correlation structure to that of a fractional Brownian motion. By studying a certain distributional limit theorem associated with such a process, we explain the emergence of an extremely skewed stable L√©vy motion as a macroscopic model for the aforementioned traffic. Surprisingly, long-range dependence vanishes in the limit, being ‚Äúreplaced‚Äù by independent increments and highly varying marginals.

We obtain a large deviation result for the buffer occupation in an asymptotic regime in which the arrival rate nr, service rate ns, and buffer level nb are scaled to infinity with a parameter n. This can be used to approximate resources which multiplex many sources, each of which only uses a small proportion of the whole capacity, albeit for long-tailed durations. We show that the probability of overflow in such systems is exponentially small in n, although the decay in b is slower, reflecting the long tailed session durations. The requirements on the session detail process are, roughly speaking, that it self-averages faster than the cumulative session duration. This does not preclude the possibility that the session detail itself has a long-range dependent behavior, such as fractional Brownian motion, or another long-tailed M/G/‚àû process.

10.1023/a:1019147006084,Heavy traffic approximations of large deviations of feedforward queueing networks,"We consider a multi-class feedforward queueing network with first come first serve queueing discipline and deterministic services and routing. The large deviation asymptotics of tail probabilities of the distribution of the workload vector can be characterized by convex path space minimization problems with non-linear constraints. So far there exists no numerical algorithm which could solve such minimization problems in a general way. When the queueing network is heavily loaded it can be approximated by a reflected Brownian motion. The large deviation asymptotics of tail probabilities of the distribution of this heavy traffic limit can again be characterized by convex path space minimization problems with non-linear constraints. However, due to their less complicated structure there exist algorithms to solve such minimization problems. In this paper we show that, as the network tends to a heavy traffic limit, the solution of the large deviation minimization problems of the network approaches the solution of the corresponding minimization problems of a reflected Brownian motion. Stated otherwise, we show that large deviation and heavy traffic asymptotics can be interchanged. We prove this result in the case when the network is initially empty. Without proof we state the corresponding result in the stationary case.

The server serves the two queues with a Bernoulli service schedule described as follows. At the beginning of each visit to a queue, the server always serves a customer. At each epoch of service completion in the ith queue at which the queue is not empty, the server makes a random decision: with probability pi, it serves the next customer; with probability 1-pi, it switches to the other queue. The server takes switching times in its transition from one queue to the other. We derive the generating functions of the joint stationary queue-length distribution at service completion instants, by using the approach of the boundary value problem for complex variables. We also determine the Laplace-Stieltjes transforms of waiting time distributions for both queues, and obtain their mean waiting times.",1998,1998-12,30,4-Mar,405-434,"Feng, W.

Conversely, the rate of change of the content of the reservoir is determined by the state of the queueing system, since the reservoir fills during idle periods and depletes during busy periods of the server. Our interest focuses on the stationary joint distribution of the number of customers in the system and the content of the fluid reservoir, from which various performance measures such as the steady-state sojourn time distribution of a customer may be obtained. We study two variants of the system. For the first, in which the fluid reservoir is infinitely large, we present an exact analysis. The variant in which the fluid reservoir is finite is analysed approximatively through a discretization technique. The system may serve as a mathematical model for a traffic regulation mechanism - a two-level traffic shaper - at the edge of an ATM network, regulating a very bursty source.

10.1023/a:1019155307901,On the departure process of a leaky bucket system with long-range dependent input traffic,"Due to the strong experimental evidence that the traffic to be offered to future broadband networks will display long-range dependence, it is important to study the possible implications that such traffic may have for the design and performance of these networks. In particular, an important question is whether the offered traffic preserves its long-range dependent nature after passing through a policing mechanism at the interface of the network. One of the proposed solutions for flow control in the context of the emerging ATM standard is the so-called leaky bucket scheme. In this paper we consider a leaky bucket system with long-range dependent input traffic. We adopt the following popular model for long-range dependent traffic: Time is discrete. At each unit time a random number of sessions is initiated, having the distribution of a Poisson random variable with mean Œª. Each of these sessions has a random duration œÑ, where the integer random variable œÑ has finite mean, infinite variance, and a regularly varying tail, i.e., P(œÑ >–ö) ~ –ö-LŒ±L(–ö), where 1 < Œ± < 2 L(¬∑) is a slowly varying function. Once a session is initiated, it generates one cell at each unit of time until its termination. We examine the departure process of the leaky bucket policing mechanism driven by such an arrival process, and show that it too is long-range dependent for any token buffer size and any - finite or infinite - cell buffer size. Moreover, upper and lower bounds for the covariance sequence of the output process are established. The above results demonstrate that long-range dependence cannot be removed by the kinds of flow control schemes that are currently being envisioned for broadband networks.",1998,1998-05,28,3-Jan,191-214,"Vamvakos, Socrates (University of California, Berkeley); Anantharam, Venkat (University of California, Berkeley)","University of California, Berkeley",16,0,,68

The focus is on determining when these processes have product form stationary distributions. The approach is to relate the marginal distributions of the process to the stationary distributions of ‚Äúnode transition functions‚Äù that represent the nodes in isolation operating under certain fictitious environments. The main result gives necessary and sufficient conditions on the node transition functions for the network process to have a product form stationary distribution. This result yields a procedure for checking for a product form distribution and obtaining such a distribution when it exits. An important subclass of networks are those in which the node transition rates have Poisson arrival components. In this setting, we show that the network process has a product form distribution and is ‚Äúbiased locally balanced‚Äù if and only if the network is ‚Äúquasi-reversible‚Äù and certain traffic equations are satisfied. Another subclass of networks are those with reversible routing. We weaken the known sufficient condition for such networks to be product form.

The policy of leaving and entering busy periods is hysteretic, meaning that, initially, the server leaves the system on multiple vacation trips whenever the queue falls below r (‚©æ1), and resumes service when during his absence the system replenishes to N or more customers upon one of his returns. During his vacation trips, the server can be called off on emergency, limiting his trips by a specified random variable (thereby encompassing several classes of vacation queues, such as ones with multiple and single vacations). If by then the queue has not reached another fixed threshold M (‚©Ω N), the server enters a so-called ‚Äúpost-vacation period‚Äù characterized by three different disciplines: waiting, or leaving on multiple vacation trips with or without emergency. For all three disciplines, the probability generating functions of the discrete and continuous time parameter queueing processes in the steady state are obtained in a closed analytic form.

Customers' transitions between stations may be either immediate or of exponentially distributed durations. Each customer is supplied with an Identification Number (ID) upon entering the network. Operational data is collected which includes transaction times (starts and terminations of services) and ID's of served customers.

This near characterization is obtained by studying a special type of virtual station called ‚Äúalternating visit virtual station‚Äù. These special virtual stations allow us to relate the necessary condition to certain indices arising in heavy traffic studies using a Brownian network approximation, as well as to certain policies proposed as being extremal with respect to the asymptotic loss in the throughput.

Each input link has its own queue of size B cells. The traffic is delay sensitive so B is small (e.g., B=20). We assume that each of the M input links carries Constant Bit Rate (CBR) traffic from a large number of independent Virtual Connections (VCs) which are subject to jitter. The fluctuations of the aggregate traffic arriving at queue i, i=1,...,M, is modeled by a Poisson process with rate Œªi. The Quality of Service (QoS) of one connection is determined in part by the queueing delay across the multiplexer and the Cell Loss Ratio (CLR) or proportion of cells from this connection lost because the buffer is full. The Oldest‚ÄêCustomer(Cell)‚ÄêFirst (OCF) discipline is a good compromise between competing protocols like round‚Äêrobin queueing or serving the longest queue. The OCF discipline minimizes the total cell delay among all cells arriving at the contending queues. Moreover, the CLR is similar to that obtained by serving the longest queue.

By studying the evolution of multinomials of the state of the system in its assumed steady state, we obtain constraints on the possible behavior of the system. Using these constraints, we obtain linear programs whose values upper and lower bound the performance measures of interest, namely throughputs or blocking probabilities. The main advantages of this new technique are that the computational complexity does not increase with the size of the finite buffers and that the technique is applicable to systems in which some buffers have infinite capacity. The technique is demonstrated on examples taken from both manufacturing systems and communication networks.

The propagation delays can be nonnegligible. For a general class of feedback algorithms, we obtain the stability of the system in the presence of one or more bottleneck nodes in the virtual circuit. Our system is general enough that it can be useful to study feedback control in other network protocols. We also obtain rates of convergence to the stationary distributions and finiteness of moments.

10.1023/a:1019165004692,Periodic load balancing,"Multiprocessor load balancing aims to improve performance by moving jobs from highly loaded processors to more lightly loaded processors. Some schemes allow only migration of new jobs upon arrival, while other schemes allow migration of jobs in progress. A difficulty with all these schemes, however, is that they require continuously maintaining detailed state information. In this paper we consider the alternative of periodic load balancing, in which the loads are balanced only at each T time units for some appropriate T. With periodic load balancing, state information is only needed at the balancing times. Moreover, it is often possible to use slightly stale information collected during the interval between balancing times. In this paper we study the performance of periodic load balancing. We consider multiple queues in parallel with unlimited waiting space to which jobs come either in separate independent streams or by assignment (either random or cyclic) from a single stream. Resource sharing is achieved by periodically redistributing the jobs or the work in the system among the queues. The performance of these systems of queues coupled by periodic load balancing depends on the transient behavior of a single queue. We focus on useful approximations obtained by considering a large number of homogeneous queues and a heavy load. When the number of queues is sufficiently large, the number of jobs or quantity of work at each queue immediately after redistribution tends to evolve deterministically, by the law of large numbers. The steady-state (limiting) value of this deterministic sequence is obtained as the solution of a fixed point equation, where the initial value is equal to the expected transient value over the interval between successive redistributions conditional on the initial value. A refined approximation based on the central limit theorem is a normal distribution, where the mean and variance are obtained by solving a pair of fixed-point equations. With higher loads, which is natural to consider when load balancing is performed, a heavy-traffic limit theorem shows that one-dimensional reflected Brownian motion can be used to approximately describe system performance, even with general arrival and service processes. With these approximations, we show how performance depends on the assumed arrival pattern of jobs and the model parameters. We do numerical calculations and conduct simulation experiments to show the accuracy of the approximations.",1998,1998-11,30,2-Jan,203-250,"Hj√°lmt√Ωsson, G√≠sli (AT&T (United States)); Whitt, Ward (AT&T (United States))",AT&T (United States),4,0,,69
10.1023/a:1019194922013,Heavy traffic analysis of controlled multiplexing systems,"The paper develops the mathematics of the heavy traffic approach to the control and optimal control problem for multiplexing systems, where there are many mutually independent sources which feed into a single channel via a multiplexer (or of networks composed of such subsystems). Due to the widely varying bit rates over all sources, control over admission, bandwidth, etc., is needed to assure good performance. Optimal control and heavy traffic analysis has been shown to yield systems with greatly improved performance. Indeed, the heavy traffic approach covers many cases of great current interest, and provides a useful and practical approach to problems of analysis and control arising in modern high speed telecommunications. Past works on the heavy traffic approach to the multiplexing problem concentrated on the uncontrolled system or on the use of the heavy traffic limit control problem for applications, and did not provide details of the proofs. This is done in the current paper. The basic control problem for the physical system is hard, and the heavy traffic approach provides much simplification. Owing to the presence of the control, as well as to the fact that the cost function of main interest is ‚Äúergodic‚Äù, the problem cannot be fully treated with ‚Äúclassical‚Äù methods of heavy traffic analysis for queueing networks. A basic result is that the optimal average costs per unit time for the physical problem converge to the optimal cost per unit time for the limit stationary process as the number of sources and the time interval goes to infinity. This convergence is both in the mean and pathwise senses. Furthermore, a ‚Äúnice‚Äù nearly optimal control for the limit system provides nearly optimal values for the physical system, under heavy traffic, in both a mean and pathwise sense.",1998,1998-05,28,3-Jan,79-107,"Kushner, Harold J.

Analysis of single product (customer) systems operating under such a policy, also known as the N-policy, has been available for some time. This article develops mathematical analysis for multiproduct systems operating under a cyclic exhaustive or globally gated service regime and a threshold start-up rule. It pays particular attention to modeling switchover (setup) times. The analysis extends/unifies existing literature on polling models by obtaining as special cases, the continuously roving server and patient server polling models on the one hand, and the standard M/G/1 queue with N-policy, on the other hand. We provide a computationally efficient algorithm for finding aggregate performance measures, such as the mean waiting time for each customer type and the mean unfinished work in system.

If either resource is being used, the customer is denied service. Customers arrive at each server according to independent Poisson processes, and lengths of service times at each server have an exponential distribution. We derive a closed-form formula for the expected fraction of busy servers at any time in terms of the number of servers and the utilization factor (defined as the arrival rate times the mean service-time duration). This allows us to evaluate system performance when these parameters are varied, and to determine whether denying service to arrivals at alternate servers improves performance.

Each arrival requires a single service, which may be provided by any of several different servers in our general formulation; the service time distribution depends on both the job class being processed and the server selected. The system manager seeks to minimize holding costs by dynamically scheduling waiting jobs onto available servers. A linear program involving only first‚Äêmoment data (average arrival rates and mean service times) is used to define heavy traffic for a system of this form, and also to articulate a condition of overlapping server capabilities which leads to resource pooling in the heavy traffic limit. Assuming that the latter condition holds, we rescale time and state space in standard fashion, then identify a Brownian control problem that is the formal heavy traffic limit of our rescaled scheduling problem. Because of the assumed overlap in server capabilities, the limiting Brownian control problem is effectively one‚Äêdimensional, and it admits a pathwise optimal solution. That is, in the limiting Brownian control problem the multiple servers of our original model merge to form a single pool of service capacity, and there exists a dynamic control policy which minimizes cumulative cost incurred up to any time t with probability one. Interpreted in our original problem context, the Brownian solution suggests the following: virtually all backlogged work should be held in one particular job class, and all servers can and should be productively employed except when the total backlog is small. It is conjectured that such ideal system behavior can be approached using a family of relatively simple scheduling policies related to the cŒº rule.",1999,1999-01,33,4,339-368,"Harrison, J.

The most typical case where the initial value function is taken to be zero may be a particularly bad choice. In contrast, if the value iteration algorithm is initialized with a stochastic Lyapunov function, then the following hold: (i) a stochastic Lyapunov function exists for each intermediate policy, and hence each policy is regular (a strong stability condition), (ii) intermediate costs converge to the optimal cost, and (iii) any limiting policy is average cost optimal. It is argued that a natural choice for the initial value function is the value function for the associated deterministic control problem based upon a fluid model, or the approximate solution to Poisson‚Äôs equation obtained from the LP of Kumar and Meyn.

In the case when the the performance deterioration is the most extreme, we quantify it by studying the time until the amount of work in the system causes an overflow of a large buffer.

The dynamics of the system evolve in discrete-time and the generalized processor sharing (GPS) scheduling policy of [25] is implemented. The arrival process in each buffer is an arbitrary, and possibly autocorrelated, stochastic process. We obtain a large deviations asymptotic for the buffer overflow probability at each buffer. In the standard large deviations methodology, we provide a lower and a matching (up to first degree in the exponent) upper bound on the buffer overflow probabilities. We view the problem of finding a most likely sample path that leads to an overflow as an optimal control problem. Using ideas from convex optimization we analytically solve the control problem to obtain both the asymptotic exponent of the overflow probability and a characterization of most likely modes of overflow.

By simple arguments we show that for any stationary nonpreemptive service policy at the queue, the stationary sojourn time of a typical session must stochastically dominate a regularly varying random variable having infinite mean; this is true even if the duration of a session is known at the time it arrives. On the other hand, we show that there exist causal stationary preemptive policies, which do not need knowledge of the session durations at the time of arrival, for which the stationary sojourn time of a typical session is stochastically dominated by a regularly varying random variable having finite mean.

Assuming that each station has a traffic intensity parameter less than one, all policies in the family considered are shown to be stable. In such a policy, system status is reviewed at discrete points in time, and at each such point the controller formulates a processing plan for the next review period, based on the queue length vector observed.

The bottleneck station is defined asymptotically as the station where the number of customers grows proportionally to the total number of customers in the network, as the latter increases simultaneously with service rates at PS stations. For the case when K=M=2, the set of network parameters is identified that corresponds to each of the three possible types of behavior in heavy traffic: both PS stations are bottlenecks, only one PS station is a bottleneck, and a group of two PS stations is a bottleneck while neither PS station forms a bottleneck by itself. In the last case both PS stations are equally loaded by each customer class and their individual queue lengths, normalized by the large parameter, converge to uniformly distributed random variables. These results are directly generalized for arbitrary K=M. Generalizations for K‚â†M are also indicated.

For a K-station tandem network of single server queues with infinite buffer capacity, which is one of the simplest models in this class, we first show that if the tail of the service time distribution of one server, say server i0 ‚àà {1,...,K}, is subexponential and heavier than those of the other servers, then the stationary distribution of the response time until the completion of service at server j ‚©æ i0 asymptotically behaves like the stationary response time distribution in an isolated single-server queue with server i0. Similar asymptotics are given in the case when several service time distributions are subexponential and asymptotically tail-equivalent. This result is then extended to the asymptotics of general (max,+)-linear systems associated with i.i.d. driving matrices having one (or more) dominant diagonal entry in the subexponential class. In the irreducible case, the asymptotics are surprisingly simple, in comparison with results of the same kind in the Cram√©r case: the asymptotics only involve the excess distribution of the dominant diagonal entry, the mean value of this entry, the intensity of the arrival process, and the Lyapunov exponent of the sequence of driving matrices. In the reducible case, asymptotics of the same kind, though somewhat more complex, are also obtained. As a direct application, we give the asymptotics of stationary response times in a class of stochastic Petri nets called event graphs. This is based on the assumption that the firing times are independent and that the tail of the firing times of one of the transitions is subexponential and heavier than those of the others. An extension of these results to nonrenewal input processes is discussed.

Service times may depend on arrival phase states, that is, there are many types of arrivals which have different service time distributions. The service process is a heterogeneous Markov renewal process, and so our model necessarily includes known models. At first, we consider the first passage time from level {Œ∫+1} (the set of the states that the number of customers in the system is Œ∫+1) to level {Œ∫} when a batch arrival occurs at time 0 and then a customer service included in that batch simultaneously starts. The service descipline is considered as a LIFO (Last‚ÄêIn First‚ÄêOut) with preemption. This discipline has the fundamental role for the analysis of the first passage time. Using this first passage time distribution, the busy period length distribution can be obtained. The busy period remains unaltered in any service disciplines if they are work‚Äêconserving. Next, we analyze the stationary workload distribution (the stationary virtual waiting time distribution). The workload as well as the busy period remain unaltered in any service disciplines if they are work‚Äêconserving. Based on this fact, we derive the Laplace‚ÄìStieltjes transform for the stationary distribution of the actual waiting time under a FIFO discipline. In addition, we refer to the Laplace‚ÄìStieltjes transforms for the distributions of the actual waiting times of the individual types of customers. Using the relationship between the stationary waiting time distribution and the stationary distribution of the number of customers in the system at departure epochs, we derive the generating function for the stationary joint distribution of the numbers of different types of customers at departures.",1999,1999-01,33,4,277-291,"Machihara, Fumiaki (Tokyo Denki University)",Tokyo Denki University,12,1,,88

The approach consists in studying the stability of a system where each node on the path followed by the packets of the controlled connection is modeled by a FIFO (First-In-First-Out) queue of infinite capacity which receives in addition some cross traffic represented by an exogenous flow. Under general stochastic assumptions, namely for stationary and ergodic input processes, we show the existence of a maximum throughput allowed by the flow control. Then we establish bounds on the value of this maximum throughput. These bounds, which do not coincide in general, are reached by time-space scalings of the exogenous flows. Therefore, the performance of the window flow control depends not only on the traffic intensity of the cross flows, but also on fine statistical characteristics such as the burstiness of these flows. These results are illustrated by several examples, including the case of a nonmonotone, nonconvex and fractal stability region.",1999,1999-09,32,3-Jan,195-231,"Baccelli, F.

Our analysis, which is based on distributional laws, relaxes the Poisson assumption that characterizes the polling systems literature. In particular, we obtain exact decomposition results for systems with either Mixed Generalized Erlang (MGE) arrival processes, or asymptotically exact decomposition results for systems with general renewal arrival processes under heavy traffic conditions.

10.1023/a:1019199306934,On a random variable associated with excursions in an M/M/‚àû system,"We show in this paper how the theory of continued fractions can be used to invert the Laplace transform of a transient characteristic associated with excursions in an M/M/‚àû system with unit service rate and input intensity u. The characteristic under consideration is the area V swept under the occupation process of an M/M/‚àû queue during an excursion period above a given threshold C. The Laplace transform V‚ãÜ of this random variable has been established in earlier studies and can be expressed as a ratio of Tricomi functions. In this paper, we first establish the continued fraction representation of V‚ãÜ, which allows us to obtain an alternative expression of the Laplace transform in terms of Kummer functions. It then turns out that the continued fraction considered is the even part of a Stieltjes (S) fraction, which provides information on the location of the poles of V‚ãÜ. It appears that the Laplace transform has simple poles on the real negative axis. Taking benefit of the fact that the spectrum is compact and that the numerical values of the Laplace transform can easily be computed by means of the continued fraction, we finally use a classical Laplace transform inversion technique to numerically compute the survivor probability distribution function x‚ûô‚Ñô{V > fx} of the random variable V, which exhibits an exponential decay only for very large values of the argument x when the ratio u/C is sufficiently smaller than one.",1999,1999-11,32,4,305-318,"Guillemin, Fabrice (Orange (France)); Pinchon, Didier (Paul Sabatier University)",Paul Sabatier University; Orange (France),5,0,,42

Customers are allowed to be heterogeneous in their preferences and consequent behavior. Our goal is to characterize customers' patience via more basic primitives, specifically waiting costs and service benefits: these two are optimally balanced by waiting customers, based on their individual cost parameters and anticipated waiting time. The waiting time distribution and patience profile then emerge as an equilibrium point of the system. The problem formulation is motivated by teleservices, prevalently telephone- and Internet-based. In such services, customers and servers are remote and queues are typically associated with the servers, hence queues are invisible to waiting customers. Our base model is the M/M/m queue, where it is shown that a unique equilibrium exists, in which rational abandonments can occur only upon arrival (zero or infinite patience for each customer). As such a behavior fails to capture the essence of abandonments, the base model is modified to account for unusual congestion or failure conditions. This indeed facilitates abandonments in finite time, leading to a nontrivial, customer dependent patience profile. Our analysis shows, quite surprisingly, that the equilibrium is unique in this case as well, and amenable to explicit calculation.",2000,2000-11,36,3-Jan,141-173,"Mandelbaum, Avishai (Technion ‚Äì Israel Institute of Technology); Shimkin, Nahum (Technion ‚Äì Israel Institute of Technology)",Technion ‚Äì Israel Institute of Technology,71,9,1,377

10.1023/a:1019143505968,The impact of a heavy-tailed service-time distribution upon the M/GI/s waiting-time distribution,"By exploiting an infinite-server-model lower bound, we show that the tails of the steady-state and transient waiting-time distributions in the M/GI/s queue with unlimited waiting room and the first-come first-served discipline are bounded below by tails of Poisson distributions. As a consequence, the tail of the steady-state waiting-time distribution is bounded below by a constant times the sth power of the tail of the service-time stationary-excess distribution. We apply that bound to show that the steady-state waiting-time distribution has a heavy tail (with appropriate definition) whenever the service-time distribution does. We also establish additional results that enable us to nearly capture the full asymptotics in both light and heavy traffic. The difference between the asymptotic behavior in these two regions shows that the actual asymptotic form must be quite complicated.",2000,2000-11,36,3-Jan,71-87,"Whitt, Ward ()",,36,1,3,209

The basis of our approach is a fitting algorithm which approximates a power-tail distribution by a hyperexponential distribution. This algorithm possesses several key properties. First, the approximation can be achieved within any desired degree of accuracy. Second, the fitted hyperexponential distribution depends only on a few parameters. Third, only a small number of exponentials are required in order to obtain an accurate approximation over many time scales. Once equipped with a fitted hyperexponential distribution, we have an integrated framework for analyzing queueing systems with power-tail distributions. We consider the GI/G/1 queue with Pareto distributed service time and show how our approach allows to derive both quantitative numerical results and asymptotic closed-form results. This derivation shows that classical teletraffic methods can be employed for the analysis of power-tail distributions.",2000,2000-11,36,3-Jan,243-267,"Starobinski, David (University of California, Berkeley); Sidi, Moshe (Technion ‚Äì Israel Institute of Technology)","University of California, Berkeley; Technion ‚Äì Israel Institute of Technology",36,1,,121

We show that the output stream of a synchronization queue is a Markov renewal process, and that the time between consecutive departures has a phase type distribution.

These results are mainly based on two ingredients: (1) a (max,+)-linear model of the time dynamic of the system under consideration, and (2) the time-invariance of the structure of the (max,+)-model. Unfortunately, (max,+)-linearity is a purely algebraic concept and it is by no means immediate if a queueing network admits a (max,+)-linear representation satisfying (1) and (2). In this paper we derive the condition a queueing network must meet if it is to have a (max,+)-linear representation.

Under the same rate conditions, for general regenerative arrival streams, we obtain the rates of convergence to stationarity, finiteness of stationary moments and various functional limit theorems. Our arrival streams contain all the traffic models suggested in the recent literature, including the ones which display long range dependence. We also obtain bounds on the stationary moments of waiting times which can be tight under realistic conditions. Finally, we obtain several results on the transient performance of the system, e.g., first time to overflow and the limits of the overflow process.

We emphasize alternatives to the familiar heavy-traffic FCLTs with reflected Brownian motion (RBM) limit process that arise with heavy-tailed probability distributions and strong dependence. Just as for the familiar convergence to RBM, the alternative FCLTs are obtained by applying the continuous mapping theorem with the reflection map to previously established FCLTs for partial sums. We consider a discrete-time model and first assume that the cumulative net-input process has stationary and independent increments, with jumps up allowed to have infinite variance or even infinite mean. For essentially a single model, the queue must be in heavy traffic and the limit is a reflected stable process, whose steady-state distribution can be calculated by numerically inverting its Laplace transform. For a sequence of models, the queue need not be in heavy traffic, and the limit can be a general reflected L√©vy process. When the L√©vy process representing the net input has no negative jumps, the steady-state distribution of the reflected L√©vy process again can be calculated by numerically inverting its Laplace transform. We also establish FCLTs for the queue-content process when the input process is a superposition of many independent component arrival processes, each of which may exhibit complex dependence. Then the limiting input process is a Gaussian process. When the limiting net-input process is also a Gaussian process and there is unlimited waiting room, the steady-state distribution of the limiting reflected Gaussian process can be conveniently approximated.",2000,2000-11,36,3-Jan,39-70,"Whitt, Ward ()",,16,1,,121

These bounds decay algebraically slow with buffer-size growth and exponentially fast with excess of channel capacity over traffic rate.

In this paper, we characterize the departure processes for a large class of such queueing systems. Results obtained include the Laplace‚ÄìStieltjes transform (LST) of the stationary distribution function of interdeparture times and recursive formula for {cn ‚â° the covariance between interdeparture times of lag n}. Departure processes of queues are difficult to characterize and for queues other than M/G/1 this is the first time that {cn} can be computed through an explicit recursive formula. With this formula, we can calculate {cn} very quickly, which provides deeper insight into the correlation structure of the departure process compared to the previous research. Numerical examples show that increasing server irregularity (i.e., the randomness of the service time distribution) destroys the short-range dependence of interdeparture times, while increasing system load strengthens both the short-range and the long-range dependence of interdeparture times. These findings show that the correlation structure of the departure process is greatly affected by server regularity and system load. Our results can also be applied to the performance analysis of a series of queues.

As expected, the limits we obtain for short-range dependent inputs involve the standard Brownian motion. Of particular interest are the conclusions for the long-range dependent case: the normalized queue length can be expressed as a function not of a fractional Brownian motion, but of an Œ±-stable, 1/Œ± self-similar independent increment L√©vy process. The resulting buffer content distribution in heavy traffic is expressed through a Mittag‚ÄìLeffler special function and displays a hyperbolic decay of power 1-Œ±.

The arrival process can be continuous- or discrete-time Markovian processes. It can be either renewal or non-renewal. The service of a customer commences at the beginning of a slot, consumes a random number of slots, and completes at the end of a later slot. The service times are independent and follow a common and general distribution. Systems with and without server vacations are both treated in this paper. These queueing systems have potential applications in asynchronous transfer mode (ATM) networks, packet radio networks, etc. Since the output process of a node in a queueing network becomes an input process to some node at the next stage, the results of this paper can be used to facilitate end-to-end performance analysis which has attracted more and more attention in the literature.",2000,2000-11,36,3-Jan,201-220,"Ferng, Huei-Wen (); Chang, Jin-Fu ()",,8,0,,137
10.1023/a:1019133809177,Dynamic service sharing with heterogeneous preferences,"We consider a service system where individual users share a common resource, modeled as a processor-sharing queue. Arriving users observe the current load in the system, and should decide whether to join it or not. The motivation for this model is based, in part, on best-effort service classes in computer communication networks. This decision problem is modeled as a noncooperative dynamic game between the users, where each user will enter the system only if its expected service time (given the system description and policies of subsequent users) is not larger than its quality of service (QoS) requirement. The present work generalizes previous results by Altman and Shimkin (1998), where all users were assumed identical in terms of their QoS requirements and decision policies; here we allow heterogeneous requirements, hence different policies. The main result is the existence and uniqueness of the equilibrium point in this system, which specifies a unique threshold policy for each user type. Computation of the equilibrium thresholds are briefly discussed, as well as dynamic learning schemes which motivate the Nash equilibrium solution for this system.",2000,2000-07,35,4-Jan,83-103,"Ben-Shahar, Israel (Technion ‚Äì Israel Institute of Technology); Orda, Ariel (Technion ‚Äì Israel Institute of Technology); Shimkin, Nahum (Technion ‚Äì Israel Institute of Technology)",Technion ‚Äì Israel Institute of Technology,8,0,,134

The network considered here consists of a central node (hub), being an infinite-server queueing system with exponentially distributed service times, and k single-server satellite stations (nodes) with generally distributed service times with rates depending on the value N. The service mechanism of these k satellite stations is autonomous, i.e., every satellite server j serves the customers only at random instants that form a strictly stationary and ergodic sequence of random variables. Assuming that the first k-1 satellite stations operate in light usage regime the paper considers the cases where the kth satellite station is a bottleneck node. The approach of the paper is based both on development of the method from the paper by Kogan and Liptser [16], where a Markovian version of this model has been studied, and on development of the up- and down-crossing method.",2000,2000-07,35,4-Jan,23-54,,,7,0,,56

This paper presents a novel approach to real-time scheduling based on a queueing theory model. Using real-time queueing theory (RTQT), one can analytically determine the distribution of the lead-time profile (i.e., the time until the deadline is reached) of customers waiting for service. Emphasis is placed on the development of the equations used to determine the lead-time profile distribution. The development of the GI/G/1 case is presented and confirmed using simulation. Simulation results confirm prior research for the M/M/1 and GI/M/1 case. As a practical application, RTQT is used to implement a packet admission control algorithm for a telecommunications network.

10.1023/a:1019174918263,Bandwidth allocation for guaranteed versus best effort service categories,"Modern communication networks evolve towards integration of guaranteed-performance and best-effort service types. The coexistence of these two service types offers substantial benefits, such as resource sharing between service classes, and the ability of the user to select an appropriate service class according to its individual requirements and preferences. Notwithstanding, such interaction gives rise to more complicated system behavior and related performance issues, which need to be explored and understood in order to allow efficient network operation. In this paper we examine potential congestion phenomena, which arise due to the combined effect of bandwidth sharing and user migration between service classes. We propose a simplified fluid model for session flow, consisting of two coupled queues with state-dependent flows, which captures the essential ingredients of service-class interaction. Our analysis shows that the system might exhibit bistable behavior, in the sense that transient congestion may stir the system from a stable and efficient operating point to an inefficient and congested one. We identify conditions which give rise to bistability, and propose a call admission control scheme which prevents the system from getting trapped in a congested-type equilibrium, while not interfering with normal system operation.",2000,2000-11,36,3-Jan,89-105,"Altman, E.

10.1023/a:1019148817838,Bounds for the tail distribution in a queue with a superposition of general periodic Markov sources: theory and application,"An efficient yet accurate estimation of the tail distribution of the queue length has been considered as one of the most important issues in call admission and congestion controls in ATM networks. The arrival process in ATM networks is essentially a superposition of sources which are typically bursty and periodic either due to their origin or their periodic slot occupation after traffic shaping. In this paper, we consider a discrete-time queue where the arrival process is a superposition of general periodic Markov sources. The general periodic Markov source is rather general since it is assumed only to be irreducible, stationary and periodic. Note also that the source model can represent multiple time-scale correlations in arrivals. For this queue, we obtain upper and lower bounds for the asymptotic tail distribution of the queue length by bounding the asymptotic decay constant. The formulas can be applied to a queue having a huge number of states describing the arrival process. To show this, we consider an MPEG-like source which is a special case of general periodic Markov sources. The MPEG-like source has three time-scale correlations: peak rate, frame length and a group of pictures. We then apply our bound formulas to a queue with a superposition of MPEG-like sources, and provide some numerical examples to show the numerical feasibility of our bounds. Note that the number of states in a Markov chain describing the superposed arrival process is more than 1.4 √ó 1088. Even for such a queue, the numerical examples show that the order of the magnitude of the tail distribution can be readily obtained.",2000,2000-03,34,4-Jan,67-100,"Ishizaki, Fumio (Tokushima University); Takine, Tetsuya (Kyoto University)",Tokushima University; Kyoto University,4,0,,59
10.1023/a:1010983510051,A Mathematical Programming Approach to Optimal Markovian Switching of Poisson Arrival Streams to Queueing Systems,"Motivated by certain situations in manufacturing systems and communication networks, we look into the problem of maximizing the profit in a queueing system with linear reward and cost structure and having a choice of selecting the streams of Poisson arrivals according to an independent Markov chain. We view the system as a MMPP/GI/1 queue and seek to maximize the profits by optimally choosing the stationary probabilities of the modulating Markov chain. We consider two formulations of the optimization problem. The first one (which we call the PUT problem) seeks to maximize the profit per unit time whereas the second one considers the maximization of the profit per accepted customer (the PAC problem). In each of these formulations, we explore three separate problems. In the first one, the constraints come from bounding the utilization of an infinite capacity server; in the second one the constraints arise from bounding the mean queue length of the same queue; and in the third one the finite capacity of the buffer reflect as a set of constraints. In the problems bounding the utilization factor of the queue, the solutions are given by essentially linear programs, while the problems with mean queue length constraints are linear programs if the service is exponentially distributed. The problems modeling the finite capacity queue are non-convex programs for which global maxima can be found. There is a rich relationship between the solutions of the PUT and PAC problems. In particular, the PUT solutions always make the server work at a utilization factor that is no less than that of the PAC solutions.",2000,2000-12,36,4,443-461,"Hemachandra, N.

Further suppose the queue is in heavy traffic, meaning that its traffic intensity parameter is near the critical value of one. A system manager must decide whether or not to accept new jobs as they arrive, and also the order in which to serve jobs that are accepted. The goal is to minimize penalties associated with rejected jobs, subject to upper bound constraints on the throughput times for accepted jobs; both the penalty for rejecting a job and the bound on the throughput time may depend on job class. This problem formulation does not make sense in a conventional queueing model, because throughput times are random variables, but we show that the formulation is meaningful in an asymptotic sense, as one approaches the heavy traffic limit under diffusion scaling. Moreover, using a method developed recently by Bramson and Williams, we prove that a relatively simple dynamic control policy is asymptotically optimal in this framework. Our proposed policy rejects jobs from one particular class when the server's nominal workload is above a threshold value, accepting all other arrivals; and the sequencing rule for accepted jobs is one that maintains near equality of the relative backlogs for different classes, defined in a natural sense.",2001,2001-09,39,1,23-54,"Plambeck, Erica (Stanford University); Kumar, Sunil (Stanford University); Harrison, J.

10.1023/a:1012796517394,Analysis of Markov Multiserver Retrial Queues with Negative Arrivals,"Negative arrivals are used as a control mechanism in many telecommunication and computer networks. In the paper we analyze multiserver retrial queues; i.e., any customer finding all servers busy upon arrival must leave the service area and re-apply for service after some random time. The control mechanism is such that, whenever the service facility is full occupied, an exponential timer is activated. If the timer expires and the service facility remains full, then a random batch of customers, which are stored at the retrial pool, are automatically removed. This model extends the existing literature, which only deals with a single server case and individual removals. Two different approaches are considered. For the stable case, the matrix‚Äìanalytic formalism is used to study the joint distribution of the service facility and the retrial pool. The approximation by more simple infinite retrial model is also proved. In the overloading case we study the transient behaviour of the trajectory of the suitably normalized retrial queue and the long-run behaviour of the number of busy servers.

It is widely recognized that the queue length distribution in a FIFO queue with multiple non-Poissonian arrival streams having different service time distributions is very hard to analyze, since we have to keep track of the complete order of customers in the queue to describe the queue length dynamics. In this paper, we provide an alternative way to solve the problem for a class of such queues, where arrival streams are governed by a finite-state Markov chain. We characterize the joint probability generating function of the stationary queue length distribution, by considering the joint distribution of the number of customers arriving from each stream during the stationary attained waiting time.

Note that this law relates the time-average joint queue length distribution with the stationary sojourn time distributions of customers from respective arrival streams. As an application of the law, we consider two variants of FIFO queues with vacations, where the service time distribution of customers from each arrival stream is assumed to be general and service time distributions of customers may be different for different arrival streams. For each queue, the stationary waiting time distribution of customers from each arrival stream is first examined, and then applying the Little's law, we obtain an equation which the probability generating function of the joint queue length distribution satisfies.

This queue has a periodic BMAP arrival process, which is defined in this paper, and phase-type service time distributions. As a Markovian queue, it can be analysed like an (inhomogeneous) Markov jump process. The transient distribution is derived by solving the Kolmogorov forward equations. Furthermore, a stability condition in terms of arrival and service rates is proven and for the case of stability, the asymptotic distribution is given explicitly.

These queueing networks consist of central node (hub) and k single-server satellite stations. The case of infinite server hub with exponentially distributed service times is considered in the first section to demonstrate the up- and down-crossing approach to such kind of problems and help to understand the readers the main idea of the method. The main results of the paper are related to the case of single-server hub with generally distributed service times depending on queue-length. Assuming that the first k‚àí1 satellite nodes operate in light usage regime, we consider three cases concerning the kth satellite node. They are the light usage regime and limiting cases for the moderate usage regime and heavy usage regime. The results related to light usage regime show that, as the number of customers in network increases to infinity, the network is decomposed to independent single-server queueing systems. In the limiting cases of moderate usage regime, the diffusion approximations of queue-length and waiting time processes are obtained. In the case of heavy usage regime it is shown that the joint limiting non-stationary queue-lengths distribution at the first k‚àí1 satellite nodes is represented in the product form and coincides with the product of stationary GI/M/1 queue-length distributions with parameters depending on time.",2001,2001-06,38,2,149-184,,,7,0,,61

Probabilistic expressions are derived for coefficients of all orders. Even though the computation of these coefficients can be hard for certain systems, it is sufficient to compute only a few coefficients to obtain good approximations (especially under the assumption of light traffic). Combining this new result with the earlier expansion formula for the mean stationary waiting times, we also provide a Taylor series expansion for the covariance of stationary waiting times in such systems.It is well known that (max,+)-linear systems can be used to represent stochastic Petri nets belonging to the class of event graphs.

Hard on the heels of the early results on queueing networks followed a series of papers which discussed the relationship between product-form stationary distributions and the quasireversibility of network nodes. More recently, the definition of quasireversibility and the coupling mechanism between nodes have been extended so that they apply to some of the later product-form queueing networks incorporating negative customers, signals, and batch movements.In parallel with this research, it has been shown that some special queueing networks can have arrival and service parameters which depend upon the network state, rather than just the node state, and still retain a generalised product-form stationary distribution.In this paper we begin by offering an alternative proof of a product-form result of Chao and Miyazawa and then build on this proof by postulating a state-dependent coupling mechanism for a quasireversible network.

The SRBM serves as an approximate model of queueing networks with finite buffers. Our BNAfm algorithm is based on the finite element method and an extension of a generic algorithm developed by Dai and Harrison [14]. It uses piecewise polynomials to form an approximate subspace of an infinite-dimensional functional space. The BNAfm algorithm is shown to produce good estimates for stationary probabilities, in addition to stationary moments. This is in contrast to the BNAsm algorithm (Brownian network analyzer with spectral method) of Dai and Harrison [14], which uses global polynomials to form the approximate subspace and which sometimes fails to produce meaningful estimates of these stationary probabilities. Extensive computational experiences from our implementation are reported, which may be useful for future numerical research on SRBMs. A three-station tandem network with finite buffers is presented to illustrate the effectiveness of the Brownian approximation model and our BNAfm algorithm.",2002,2002-09,42,1,33-62,"Shen, Xinyang (University of British Columbia); Chen, Hong (University of British Columbia); Dai, J.G.

We establish that this system operating under a threshold policy can be well approximated by a one-dimensional reflected Brownian motion when the arrival rate to the network is close to the processing capacity of the two servers. As the heavy traffic limit is approached, thresholds which grow at a logarithmic rate are critical in determining the behavior of the limiting system.

A setup time is incurred if the polled queue has one or more customers present. This is the polling model with State-Dependent service (the SD model). The SD model is inherently complex; hence, it has often been approximated by the much simpler model with State-Independent service (the SI model) in which the server always sets up for a service at the polled queue, regardless of whether it has customers or not. We provide an exact analysis of the SD model and obtain the probability generating function of the joint queue length distribution at a polling epoch, from which the moments of the waiting times at the various queues are obtained. A number of numerical examples are presented, to reveal conditions under which the SD model could perform worse than the corresponding SI model or, alternately, conditions under which the SD model performs better than a corresponding model in which all setup times are zero.

GPS-based scheduling algorithms are considered important for providing differentiated quality of service in integrated-services networks. We are interested in the workload of a particular flow i at the bottleneck node on its path. Flow i is assumed to have long-tailed traffic characteristics. We distinguish between two traffic scenarios, (i) flow i generates instantaneous traffic bursts and (ii) flow i generates traffic according to an on/off process. In addition, we consider two configurations of feed-forward networks. First we focus on the situation where other flows join the path of flow i. Then we extend the model by adding flows which can branch off at any node, with cross traffic as a special case. We prove that under certain conditions the tail behaviour of the workload distribution of flow i is equivalent to that in a two-node tandem network where flow i is served in isolation at constant rates. These rates only depend on the traffic characteristics of the other flows through their average rates. This means that the results do not rely on any specific assumptions regarding the traffic processes of the other flows. In particular, flow i is not affected by excessive activity of flows with ‚Äòheavier-tailed‚Äô traffic characteristics. This confirms that GPS has the potential to protect individual flows against extreme behaviour of other flows, while obtaining substantial multiplexing gains.",2002,2002-06,41,2-Jan,123-163,,National Research Institute for Mathematics and Computer Science; Eindhoven University of Technology,14,0,,49

Associated with each packet is a deadline by which the packet must be scheduled. Each packet belongs to one of a predetermined set of classes, and each class has an associated weight value. The goal is to minimize the total weighted value of the packets that miss their deadlines. We first prove that there is no policy that minimizes this weighted loss for all finite arrival sequences of packets. We then present a class of greedy scheduling policies, called the current-minloss throughput-optimal (CMTO) policies. We characterize all CMTO policies, and provide examples of easily implementable CMTO policies. We compare CMTO policies with a multiclass extension of the earliest-deadline-first (EDF) policy, called EDF+, establishing that a subclass of CMTO policies achieves no more weighted loss than EDF+ for any traffic sequence, and at the same time achieves a substantial weighted-loss advantage over EDF+ for some traffic sequences ‚Äì this advantage is shown to be arbitrarily close to the maximum possible achievable advantage.

Service times of customers from each arrival stream are generally distributed and service time distributions for different arrival streams may be different. Under these assumptions, it is shown that the stationary joint distribution of queue strings representing from which arrival stream each customer in the system arrived and remaining service times of respective customers in the system has a matrix product-form solution, where matrices constituting the solution are given in terms of the infinitesimal generator of a certain Markov chain. Compared with the previous works, the result in this paper is more general in the sense that general service time distributions are allowed, and it has the advantage of computational efficiency. Note also that the result is a natural extension of the classical result for the LCFS-PR M/G/1 queue.

As in the case of single buffers, the results are valid for a very general class of sources which include long-range dependent sources with bounded instantaneous rates. We first consider the case of two buffers with one of them having strict priority over the other and we obtain asymptotic upper bound for the buffer tail probability for lower priority buffer. We discuss the conditions to have asymptotic equivalents. The asymptotics are studied in terms of a scaling parameter which reflects the server speed, buffer level and the number of sources in such a way that the ratios remain constant. The results are then generalized to the case of M buffers which leads to the source pooling idea. We conclude with numerical validation of our formulae against simulations which show that the asymptotic bounds are tight.

Negative customers remove (ordinary) customers in the queue and are similarly correlated and bursty. We consider both the cases where negative customers remove positive customers from the front and the end of the queue and, in the latter case, where a customer currently being served can and cannot be killed by a negative customer. These cases can model an unreliable server or load balancing respectively. The results are obtained as Laplace transforms and can be inverted numerically. The MM CPP/GE/c G-Queue therefore holds the promise of being a viable building block for the analysis of queues and queueing networks with bursty, correlated traffic, incorporating load balancing and node-failures, since the equilibrium behaviour of both queue lengths and response times can be determined in a tractable way.",2002,2002-07,41,3,271-298,"Harrison, P.G.

We introduce a so called empirical generator consisting of Qt and of two empirical measures associated with St, the position of the server at time t. One of the main step is to derive large deviations bounds for a localized version of the empirical generator. The analysis relies on a suitable change of measure and on a representation of fluid limits for polling systems. Finally, the rate function is solution of a meaningful convex program. The method seems to have a wide range of application including the famous Jackson networks, as shown at the end of this study.

10.1023/a:1017992329699,Random Walk with a Heavy-Tailed Jump Distribution,"The classical random walk of which the one-step displacement variable u has a first finite negative moment is considered. The R.W. possesses an unique stationary distribution; x is a random variable with this distribution. It is assumed that the right-hand and/or the left-hand tail of the distribution of u are heavy-tailed. For the type of heavy-tailed distribution considered in this study a contraction factor Œî(a) exists with Œî(a) ‚Üì 0 for a ‚Üë 1, and a‚Üë1 is equivalent with E{u} ‚Üë 0. It is shown that Œî(a)x converges in distribution for a‚Üë1. It is the analysis of the tail of this limiting distribution of Œî(a)x which is the main purpose of the present study in particular when u is a mix of stochastic variables ui, i=1,...,N, each ui having its own heavy tail characteristics for its right- and left-hand tails. For an important case it is shown that for the tail of the distribution of Œî(a)x an asymptotic expression in the variables Œî(a) and t for Œî(a) ‚Üì 0 and t‚Üí‚àû can be derived. For this asymptotic relation the dominating term is completely determined by the heavier tail of the 2N tails of the ui; the other terms of the asymptotic relation show the influence of less heavy tails and, depending on t, the terms may have a contribution which is not always negligible.The study starts with the derivation of a functional equation for the L.S.-transform of the distribution of x and that of the excess distribution of the stationary idle time distribution. For several important cases this functional equation could be solved and thus has led to the above mentioned asymptotic result. The derivation of it required quite some preparation, because it needed an effective description of the heavy-tailed jump sequence u. It was obtained by prescribing the heavy-tailed distributions of [u]+=max (0,u) and [u]‚àí=min (0,u). It is shown that the random walk can serve as a model for the actual waiting process of a GI/G/1 queueing model; in that case the distribution of u is that of the difference of the service time and the interarrival time. The analysis of the present study then describes the heavy-traffic theory for the case with heavy-tailed service- and/or interarrival time distribution.",2002,2002-02,40,1,35-73,"Cohen, J.W.

We drop this assumption and we study a model without incomplete batches. We prove that the stationary distribution of such a queue has a nearly geometric form.

The streams form two queues, primary (queue 1) and secondary (queue 0). The primary queue is served exhaustively, after which the server switches over to queue 0. The duration of time the server resides in the secondary queue is determined by the dynamic evolution in queue 1. If there is an arrival to queue 1 while the server is still working in queue 0, the latter is immediately gated, and the server completes service there only to the gated jobs, upon which it switches back to the primary queue. We formulate this system as a two-queue polling model with a single alternating server and with randomly-timed gated (RTG) service discipline in queue 0, where the timer there depends on the arrival stream to the primary queue. We derive Laplace‚ÄìStieltjes transforms and generating functions for various key variables and calculate numerous performance measures such as mean queue sizes at polling instants and at an arbitrary moment, mean busy period duration and mean cycle time length, expected number of messages transmitted during a busy period and mean waiting times.

In the general case, the model is an open network of infinite server queues where customers arrive according to a non-homogeneous Poisson process. The movement of a customer in the network is described by a Markov renewal process. Moreover, customers have attributes, such as a teletraffic state, that are driven by continuous time Markov chains and, therefore, change as they move through the network. We investigate the transient and limit number of customers in disjoint sets of nodes and attributes. These turn out to be independent Poisson random variables. We also calculate the covariances of the number of customers in two sets of nodes and attributes at different time epochs. Moreover, we conclude that the arrival process per attribute to a node is the sum of independent Poisson cluster processes and derive its univariate probability generating function.

Recently, the proportional relation has been verified for various discrete-time single-server queues with correlated arrivals, where it has been also shown that the proportional constant can be expressed in terms of the distribution of one system. This implies that the stationary queue length distribution of one system can be completely expressed in terms of the distribution of the other system.

This tool helps establish monotonicity properties of performance measures and also helps show that the queue-length random variables are negatively associated. The queue length at a node is asymptotically analyzed through a family of networks with a fixed number of node types, where the number of nodes approaches infinity, the ratio of jobs to nodes has a positive limit, and each node type has a limiting density.

The evolution of the stochastic process describing the number of flows on all routes, which determines the performance of the data transfers, depends on how link capacity is allocated between competing flows. We use some key properties of Whittle queueing networks to characterize the class of allocations which are insensitive in the sense that the stationary distribution of this stochastic process does not depend on any traffic characteristics (session structure, data volume distribution) except the traffic intensity on each route.

10.1023/a:1024714024248,Queueing Dynamics and Maximal Throughput Scheduling in Switched Processing Systems,"We study a processing system comprised of parallel queues, whose individual service rates are specified by a global service mode (configuration). The issue is how to switch the system between various possible service modes, so as to maximize its throughput and maintain stability under the most workload-intensive input traffic traces (arrival processes). Stability preserves the job inflow‚Äìoutflow balance at each queue on the traffic traces. Two key families of service policies are shown to maximize throughput, under the mild condition that traffic traces have long-term average workload rates. In the first family of cone policies, the service mode is chosen based on the system backlog state belonging to a corresponding cone. Two distinct policy classes of that nature are investigated, MaxProduct and FastEmpty. In the second family of batch policies (BatchAdapt), jobs are collectively scheduled over adaptively chosen horizons, according to an asymptotically optimal, robust schedule. The issues of nonpreemptive job processing and non-negligible switching times between service modes are addressed. The analysis is extended to cover feed-forward networks of such processing systems/nodes. The approach taken unifies and generalizes prior studies, by developing a general trace-based modeling framework (sample-path approach) for addressing the queueing stability problem. It treats the queueing structure as a deterministic dynamical system and analyzes directly its evolution trajectories. It does not require any probabilistic superstructure, which is typically used in previous approaches. Probability can be superposed later to address finer performance questions (e.g., delay). The throughput maximization problem is seen to be primarily of structural nature.

We consider a single point in the access network which multiplexes several bursty users. The users adapt their sending rates based on feedback from the access multiplexer. Important parameters are the user's peak transmission rate p, which is the access line speed, the user's guaranteed minimum rate r, and the bound Œµ on the fraction of lost data. Two feedback schemes are proposed. In both schemes the users are allowed to send at rate p if the system is relatively lightly loaded, at rate r during periods of congestion, and at a rate between r and p, in an intermediate region. For both feedback schemes we present an exact analysis, under the assumption that the users' file sizes and think times have exponential distributions. We use our techniques to design the schemes jointly with admission control, i.e., the selection of the number of admissible users, to maximize throughput for given p, r and Œµ.

We show a sharp dichotomy in qualitative behavior, depending on the relative values of the weight parameters. For certain weight combinations, an individual flow with long-tailed traffic characteristics is effectively served at a constant rate. The effective service rate may be interpreted as the maximum average traffic rate for the flow to be stable, which is only influenced by the traffic characteristics of the other flows through their average rates. In particular, the flow is essentially immune from excessive activity of flows with ‚Äòheavier‚Äô-tailed traffic characteristics. In many situations, the effective service rate is simply the link rate reduced by the aggregate average rate of the other flows. This confirms that GPS-based scheduling algorithms provide a potential mechanism for extracting significant multiplexing gains, while isolating individual flows. For other weight combinations however, a flow may be strongly affected by the activity of ‚Äòheavier‚Äô-tailed flows, and may inherit their traffic characteristics, causing induced burstiness. The stark contrast in qualitative behavior illustrates the crucial importance of the weight parameters.",2003,2003-04,43,4,273-306,,Eindhoven University of Technology; National Research Institute for Mathematics and Computer Science; Columbia University,34,0,,75

In this paper, we establish two properties of these workload processes. Firstly, we derive a formula for the dimension of such processes. For a given Brownian network, this dimension is unique. However, there are infinitely many possible choices for the workload process. Harrison [16] has proposed a ‚Äúcanonical‚Äù choice, which reduces the possibilities to a finite number.

When both queues are backlogged, they are each served at unit rate. However, when one queue empties, the service rate at the other queue increases. Thus, the two queues are coupled through the mechanism for dynamically sharing surplus service capacity. We derive the asymptotic workload behavior at Q1 for various scenarios where at least one of the two queues has a heavy-tailed service time distribution. First of all, we consider a situation where the traffic load at Q1 is below the nominal unit service rate. We show that if the service time distribution at Q1 is heavy-tailed, then the workload behaves exactly as if Q1 is served in isolation at a constant rate, which only depends on the service time distribution at Q2 through its mean. In addition, we establish that if the service time distribution at Q1 is exponential, then the workload distribution is either exponential or semi-exponential, depending on whether the traffic load at Q2 exceeds the nominal service rate or not. Next, we focus on a regime where the traffic load at Q1exceeds the nominal service rate, so that Q1 relies on the surplus capacity from Q2 to maintain stability. In that case, the workload distribution at Q1 is determined by the heaviest of the two service time distributions, so that Q1 may inherit potentially heavier-tailed characteristics from Q2.",2003,2003-01,43,2-Jan,81-102,,National Research Institute for Mathematics and Computer Science; Eindhoven University of Technology,25,1,,123

Essential in this procedure is the reduction of a part of the problem to a backward second order difference equation with constant coefficients. It follows that the exact solution can be found by eigenmode decomposition. In general eigenmodes do not have a simple product structure as one might expect intuitively. Further, using the exact solution, all kinds of interesting performance measures can be computed and compared with heuristic approximations (insofar available in the literature). We provide some new approximations based on special multiplicative eigenmodes, including the dominant mode in the heavy traffic limit. We illustrate our methods with numerical results.

If an optimal policy for the fluid model is ‚Äòmaximally non-idling‚Äô, then variability plays a small role in control design. If this condition does not hold, then the ‚Äògap‚Äô between the fluid and stochastic optimal policies is exactly proportional to system variability.

These servers keep taking synchronous vacations until they find waiting customers in the system at a vacation completion instant.The vacation time is a phase-type (PH) distributed random variable. Using embedded Markov chain modeling and the matrix geometric solution methods, we obtain explicit expressions for the stationary probability distributions of the queue length at arrivals and the waiting time.

10.1023/a:1022894627652,Small and Large Time Scale Analysis of a Network Traffic Model,"Empirical studies of the internet and WAN traffic data have observed multifractal behavior at time scales below a few hundred milliseconds. There have been some attempts to model this phenomenon, but there is no model to connect the small time scale behavior with behavior observed at large time scales of bigger than a few hundred milliseconds. There have been separate analyses of models for high speed data transmissions, which show that appropriate approximations to large time scale behavior of cumulative traffic are either fractional Brownian motion or stable L√©vy motion, depending on the input rates assumed. This paper tries to bridge this gap and develops and analyzes a model offering an explanation of both the small and large time scale behavior of a network traffic model based on the infinite source Poisson model. Previous studies of this model have usually assumed that transmission rates are constant and deterministic. We consider a nonconstant, multifractal, random transmission rate at the user level which results in cumulative traffic exhibiting multifractal behavior on small time scales and self-similar behavior on large time scales.",2003,2003-03,43,3,221-250,"Maulik, Krishanu (Cornell University); Resnick, Sidney (Cornell University)",Cornell University,16,1,,150

We consider three different situations: impatient customers in the waiting room, impatient customers in the system, that is, if a customer has been in the waiting room, respectively, in the system for a time units it leaves the waiting room, respectively, the system. In the third situation, all customers are patient ‚Äì that is, they only leave the system after completing service. In all three situations the service time of a customer depends upon the time he has spent in the waiting room. As opposed to the general approach in many queueing systems, we calculate the delay distribution, using matrix analytic methods, without obtaining the steady state probabilities of the queue length. The trick used in this paper, which was also applied by Van Houdt and Blondia [J. Appl. Probab., Vol. 39, No. 1 (2002) pp. 213‚Äì222], is to keep track of the ‚Äúage‚Äù of the customer in service, while remembering the D-MAP state immediately after the customer in service arrived.

The controller can either hold arriving messages in a common buffer, dispatching them to servers only when the delayed information becomes available (Wait option), or route jobs to the various channels, in a round-robin fashion, immediately upon their arrival. Interpreting the delays as servers's vacations and considering overall queue sizes as a measure of performance, we show that the Wait strategy is superior as long as the mean information delay is below a threshold. We calculate threshold values for various combinations of load and c and show that, for a given load, the threshold increases with c and, for fixed c, the threshold decreases with an increasing load. If information is delayed on arrival instants, rather than on service completions, we show that the system can be viewed as a tandem queue and derive a generalization of a queue-decomposition result obtained by Altman, Kofman and Yechiali.",2003,2003-01,43,2-Jan,147-165,"Litvak, Nelly (University of Twente; Eindhoven University of Technology); Yechiali, Uri (Tel Aviv University)",University of Twente; Tel Aviv University; Eindhoven University of Technology,14,1,,93

Both the snowfall and the snowblower's driving speed vary randomly (in both space and time coordinates). The snowblower's motion and the snowload profile on the racetrack are co-dependent and co-evolve, resulting in a coupled stochastic dynamical system of ‚Äòrandom motion (snowblower) in a random environment (snowload profile)‚Äô. Snowblowing systems are closely related to continuous polling systems ‚Äì or, so-called, polling systems on the circle ‚Äì which are the continuum limits of ‚Äòstandard‚Äô polling systems. Our aim in this manuscript is to introduce a stochastic model that would apply to a wide class of stochastic snowblower-type systems and, simultaneously, generalize the existing models of continuous polling systems. We present a general snowblowing-system model, with arbitrary L√©vy snowfall and arbitrary snowblower delays, and study it by analyzing an underlying stochastic Poincar√© map governing the system's evolution.

These expressions reveal that burstiness and correlation of the arrival process have very little impact on the departure process when a queueing system is heavily loaded. In contrast, both burstiness and correlation of the service-time process greatly affect those of the departure process regardless of the load of the system.

The G-measure associated with this Markov chain has a special structure which is usefully exploited.

10.1023/a:1021800414253,Continuous-Review Tracking Policies for Dynamic Control of Stochastic Networks,"This paper is concerned with dynamic control of stochastic processing networks. Specifically, it follows the so called ‚Äúheavy traffic approach,‚Äù where a Brownian approximating model is formulated, an associated Brownian optimal control problem is solved, the solution of which is then used to define an implementable policy for the original system. A major challenge is the step of policy translation from the Brownian to the discrete network. This paper addresses this problem by defining a general and easily implementable family of continuous-review tracking policies. Each such policy has the following structure: at each point in time t, the controller observes the current vector of queue lengths q and chooses (i) a target position z(q) of where the system should be at some point in the near future, say at time t+l, and (ii) an allocation vector v(q) that describes how to split the server's processing capacity amongst job classes in order to steer the state from q to z(q). Implementation of such policies involves the enforcement of small safety stocks. In the context of the ‚Äúheavy traffic‚Äù approach, the solution of the approximating Brownian control problem is used in selecting the target state z(q). The proposed tracking policy is shown to be asymptotically optimal in the heavy traffic limiting regime, where the Brownian model approximation becomes valid, for multiclass queueing networks that admit orthant Brownian optimal controls; this is a form of pathwise, or greedy, optimality.

10.1023/b:ques.0000032804.57988.f3,Rational Abandonment from Tele-Queues: Nonlinear Waiting Costs with Heterogeneous Preferences,"We consider the modelling of abandonment from a queueing system by impatient customers. Within the proposed model, customers act rationally to maximise a utility function that weights service utility against expected waiting cost. Customers are heterogeneous, in the sense that their utility function parameters may vary across the customer population. The queue is assumed invisible to waiting customers, who do not obtain any information regarding their standing in the queue during their waiting period. Such circumstances apply, for example, in telephone centers or other remote service facilities, to which we refer as tele-queues. We analyse this decision model within a multi-server queue with impatient customers, and seek to characterise the Nash equilibria of this system. These equilibria may be viewed as stable operating points of the system, and determine the customer abandonment profile along with other system-wide performance measures. We provide conditions for the existence and uniqueness of the equilibrium, and suggest procedures for its computation. We also suggest a notion of an equilibrium based on sub-optimal decisions, the myopic equilibrium, which enjoys favourable analytical properties. Some concrete examples are provided to illustrate the modelling approach and analysis.

By using this approach, we are able to relate the boundary conditions of the system of differential equations to a Markov chain of GI/G/1 type or a Markov renewal process of GI/G/1 type. This leads to a solution of the boundary equations, which is crucial for solving the system of differential equations.

We assume the network is monotonic in the sense that removing a customer from any node increases the service rate of all customers. Under this assumption, we give stochastic bounds on the number of customers present at any node. We also identify limiting regimes that allow to test the tightness of these bounds.

We develop a unified two-step approach to stability analysis based on a characterization of the limit behavior of the forward renewal time. This employs an extended construction (initially proposed by Foss and Kalashnikov [13]), which is widely used to transform an original one-dependent regenerative process into weakly regenerative one. It is shown that the approach simplifies stability analysis of many queuing processes. (The tightness of the queueing processes plays an important role in the proofs.) In particular, we consider both well-known classical queues and multi-server queues with regenerative input and non-identical servers.

Via a simple transformation (change of variables) technique the TLR method reduces the original rare event probability estimation with heavy tail distributions to an equivalent one with light tail distributions. Once this transformation has been established we estimate the rare event probability via importance sampling, using the classical exponential change of measure or the standard likelihood ratio change of measure. In the latter case the importance sampling distribution is chosen from the same parametric family as the transformed distribution. We estimate the optimal parameter vector of the importance sampling distribution using the cross-entropy method. We prove the polynomial complexity of the TLR method for certain heavy-tailed models and demonstrate numerically its high efficiency for various heavy-tailed models previously thought to be intractable. We also show that the TLR method can be viewed as a universal tool in the sense that not only it provides a unified view for heavy-tailed simulation but also can be efficiently used in simulation with light-tailed distributions. We present extensive simulation results which support the efficiency of the TLR method.",2004,2004-03,46,4-Mar,317-351,"Kroese, D.P. (University of Queensland); Rubinstein, R.Y.

Nonetheless, this paper uses appropriately constructed GI/G/1 models to create viable approximations for queues with correlated arrivals. The constructed renewal arrival process, called PMRS (Peakedness Matched Renewal Stream), preserves the peakedness of the original stream and its arrival rate; furthermore, the squared coefficient of variation of the constructed PMRS equals the index of dispersion of the original stream. Accordingly, the GI/G/1 approximation is termed PMRQ (Peakedness Matched Renewal Queue). To test the efficacy of the PMRQ approximation, we employed a simple variant of the TES+ process as the autocorrelated arrival stream, and simulated the corresponding TES+/G/1 queue for several service distributions and traffic intensities. Extensive experimentation showed that the proposed PMRQ approximations produced mean waiting times that compared favorably with simulation results of the original systems.

To this end, we derive a Markov renewal equation for characterizing the stationary distribution using a Markov additive process that describes the number of customers in system when the system is not empty. Variants of this Markov renewal equation are also derived. It is shown that the transition kernels of these renewal equations can be expressed by the ladder height and the associated background state of a dual Markov additive process. Usually, matrix analysis is extensively used for studying the M/G/1 type queue. However, this may not be convenient when the background states are countable.

The class-2 customers have no impatience. The required mean service times may depend on the class of the customer. As the dynamics of class-1 customers are related to the well analyzed M/M/1+GI system, our aim is to derive characteristics for class-2 customers and for the whole system. The solution of the balance equations for the partial probability generating functions of the detailed system state process is given in terms of the weak solution of a family of boundary value problems for ordinary differential equations, where the latter can be solved explicitly only for particular distributions of the maximal waiting times. By means of this solution formulae for the joint occupancy distribution and for the sojourn and waiting times of class-2 customers are derived generalizing corresponding results recently obtained by Choi et al. in case of deterministic maximal waiting times.

The exogenous stream, representing the superposition of all incoming UDP connections into a queue, has been modeled as an MMPP stream. We consider both the TCP Tahoe and the TCP Reno versions. We start with the analysis of a single TCP connection sharing a RED controlled queue with an exogenous stream. The effect of the exogenous stream (which is almost always present in large networks) is to cause the system to converge to a stationary distribution from any initial conditions. This stability result holds good for any work conserving discipline. We also obtain the performance indices of the system; specifically the goodputs and the mean sojourn times of the various connections. The complexity involved in computation of performance indices for the system is reduced by approximating the evolution of the average queue length process of the RED queue by a deterministic ODE. Then, by using a decomposition approach of two time scales, we reduce the study of the system to that of a simplified one for which the performance measures can be obtained under stationarity. Finally, we extend the above results to the case when multiple TCP connections share a RED controlled queue with an exogenous stream and to the case when a TCP connection passes through several RED controlled tandem queues each of which has an incoming exogenous stream.

As a consequence, we obtain heavy-traffic limits for the proportion of customers or input lost over an initial interval. Except for an interchange of the order of two limits, we thus obtain heavy-traffic limits for the steady-state loss proportions.

The difficulty in analyzing systems with correlated arrivals is due to the fact that the individual queueing systems are stochastically dependent. Exact methods for analyzing these systems are computationally intensive and are limited to only a few special cases. In this paper, we consider a system of parallel queues with bulk service and correlated arrivals. We show how the matrix-geometric approach can be used to obtain the performance measures of the system. We also develop an algorithm for large systems that efficiently approximates the performance measures by decomposing it into individual queueing systems. Finally, we describe how the principles of our decomposition algorithm can be extended to analyze a variety of different parallel queueing systems with correlated arrivals.

It is assumed that there are r server stations. At the initial time moment all units are distributed in the server stations, and the ith server station contains Ni units, i=1,2,...,r, where all the values Ni are large numbers of the same order. The total number of client stations is equal to k. The expected times between departures in the client stations are small values of the order O(N‚àí1) (N=N1+N2+...+Nr).

Our control policy is easy to implement and we prove that it performs well in steady state as long as the capacity request sizes are relatively small compared to the capacity of the service facilities. The policy is a target tracking policy: a linear program provides a target operating point and an exponential penalty function is used to translate the optimal deterministic point into a feasible admission and routing policy. This translation essentially transforms the admission and routing control problem into a problem of load balancing via the construction of fictitious systems.

The starting point is a sample large deviation principle on the path-space of network primitives describing the cumulative external arrivals, service time requirements and routing decisions. The behavior of the network, capturing the cumulative total arrivals, idle times and queue lengths, is characterized by a path-space fixed point equation containing the network primitives. The mapping from the network primitives to the set of fixed points is partially upper semicontinuous. This set-valued continuity allows us to derive large deviation bounds for the network behavior in the form of variational problems. The analysis is carried out on the doubly-infinite time axis R and can directly capture stationary and non-Markovian situations. By relaxing the fixed point equation the upper bounds and minimizing paths can be approximated with piecewise linear paths. For a class of typical rate functions we specify sequences of finite dimensional minimization problems which permit the calculation of large deviation rates and minimizing paths for the tail probabilities of queue lengths.

In particular, our focus is on environments with specific performance guarantees for each class under a profit model in which revenues are gained when performance guarantees are satisfied and penalties are incurred otherwise. Within the context of the corresponding fluid model, we investigate the dynamic scheduling of different classes of service under conditions where the workload of certain classes may be overloaded for a transient period of time. Specifically, we consider the case with two fluid classes and a single server whose capacity can be shared arbitrarily among the two classes. We assume that the class 1 arrival rate varies with time and the class 1 fluid can more efficiently reduce the holding cost. Under these assumptions, we characterize the optimal server allocation policy that minimizes the holding cost in the fluid model when the arrival rate function for class 1 is known. Using the insights gained from this deterministic case, we study the stochastic fluid system when the arrival rate function for class 1 is random and develop various policies that are optimal or near optimal under various conditions. In particular, we consider two different types of heavy traffic regimes and prove that our proposed policies are strongly asymptotically optimal.

We show that as the capacity and the number of flows aggregated at the upstream queue increases, the overflow probability at the downstream queue converges to that of a simplified single queue obtained by removing the upstream queue from the original two-stage queueing system. Earlier work shows such convergence for fluid traffic, by exploiting the large deviation result that the workload goes to zero almost surely, as the number of flows and capacity is scaled. However, the analysis is quite different and more difficult for the point process traffic considered in this paper. The reason is that for point process traffic the large deviation rate function need not be strictly positive (i.e., I(0)=0), hence the workload at the upstream queue may not go to zero even though the number of flows and capacity go to infinity.

10.1023/b:ques.0000021147.09071.e3,Explicit Solution for a Network Control Problem in the Large Deviation Regime,"We consider optimal control of a stochastic network, where service is controlled to prevent buffer overflow. We use a risk-sensitive escape time criterion, which in comparison to the ordinary escape time criteria heavily penalizes exits which occur on short time intervals. A limit as the buffer sizes tend to infinity is considered. In [2] we showed that, for a large class of networks, the limit of the normalized cost agrees with the value function of a differential game. In this game, one player controls the service discipline (who to serve and whether to serve), and the other player chooses arrival and service rates in the network. The game's value is characterized in [2] as the unique solution to a Hamilton‚ÄìJacobi‚ÄìBellman Partial Differential Equation (PDE). In the current paper we apply this general theory to the important case of a network of queues in tandem. Our main results are: (i) the construction of an explicit solution to the corresponding PDE, and (ii) drawing out the implications for optimal risk-sensitive and robust regulation of the network. In particular, the following general principle can be extracted. To avoid buffer overflow there is a natural competition between two tendencies. One may choose to serve a particular queue, since that will help prevent its own buffer from overflowing, or one may prefer to stop service, with the goal of preventing overflow of buffers further down the line. The solution to the PDE indicates the optimal choice between these two, specifying the parts of the state space where each queue must be served (so as not to lose optimality), and where it can idle. Referring to those queues which must be served as bottlenecks, one can use the solution to the PDE to explicitly calculate the bottleneck queues as a function of the system's state, in terms of a simple set of equations.",2004,2004-01,46,2-Jan,159-176,"Atar, Rami (Technion ‚Äì Israel Institute of Technology); Shwartz, Adam (Technion ‚Äì Israel Institute of Technology); Dupuis, Paul (Brown University)",Brown University; Technion ‚Äì Israel Institute of Technology,2,0,,69

An underlying random network mode determines the set of available controls in each time slot. Each control decision ‚Äúproduces‚Äù a certain vector of ‚Äúcommodities‚Äù; it also has associated ‚Äútraditional‚Äù queueing control effect, i.e., it determines traffic (customer) arrival rates, service rates at the nodes, and random routing of processed customers among the nodes. The problem is to find a dynamic control strategy which maximizes a concave utility function H(X), where X is the average value of commodity vector, subject to the constraint that network queues remain stable.We introduce a dynamic control algorithm, which we call Greedy Primal-Dual (GPD) algorithm, and prove its asymptotic optimality. We show that our network model and GPD algorithm accommodate a wide range of applications. As one example, we consider the problem of congestion control of networks where both traffic sources and network processing nodes may be randomly time-varying and interdependent. We also discuss a variety of resource allocation problems in wireless networks, which in particular involve average power consumption constraints and/or optimization, as well as traffic rate constraints.",2005,2005-08,50,4,401-457,,,358,9,3,953

This queue is characterized by Poisson arrivals at rate Œª, exponential service times at rate Œº, n service agents and generally distributed patience times of customers. The model is applied in the call center environment, as it captures the tradeoff between operational efficiency (staffing cost) and service quality (accessibility of agents).In our research, three asymptotic operational regimes for medium to large call centers are studied. These regimes correspond to the following three staffing rules, as Œª and n increase indefinitely and Œº held fixed:
Efficiency-Driven (ED): Numerical experiments demonstrate that, for a wide set of system parameters, the QED formulae provide excellent approximation for exact M/M/n + G performance measures.

The proposed routing scheme is FSF which assigns customers to the Fastest Servers First. The asymptotic regime considered is the Halfin-Whitt many-server heavy-traffic regime, which we refer to as the Quality and Efficiency Driven (QED) regime; it achieves high levels of both service quality and system efficiency by carefully balancing between the two.

10.1007/s11134-005-2897-8,Dynamic Routing and Admission Control in High-Volume Service Systems: Asymptotic Analysis via Multi-Scale Fluid Limits,"Motivated by applications in telephone call centers, we consider a service system model with m customer classes and r server pools. The model is one with doubly stochastic arrivals, which means that the m-vector Œª of instantaneous arrival rates is allowed to vary both temporally and stochastically. Two levels of dynamic control are considered: customers may be either blocked or accepted at the time of their arrival, and then accepted customers of each class must be routed, either immediately upon acceptance or after some period of waiting, to a server pool that is qualified to handle that class. Customers who are made to wait before commencement of their service are liable to defect. The objective is to minimize the expected sum of blocking costs, waiting costs and defection costs over a fixed and finite planning horizon. We consider an asymptotic parameter regime in which (i) the arrival rates, service rates and defection rates are uniformly accelerated by a large factor Œ∫, then (ii) arrival rates are increased by an additional factor g(Œ∫), and the number of servers in each pool is increased by g(Œ∫) as well. This produces a separation of time scales, justifying a pointwise stationary stochastic fluid approximation for our original system model. In the stochastic fluid approximation, optimal admission control and routing decisions are determined by a simple linear program that uses the current arrival rate vector Œª as data. We explain how to implement the fluid model's optimal control policy in our original service system context, and prove that the proposed implementation is asymptotically optimal in the first-order sense.",2005,2005-12,51,4-Mar,249-285,"Bassamboo, Achal (Stanford University); Harrison, J.

RDR involves no truncation and results in only small inaccuracy when compared with simulation, for a wide range of loads and variability in the job size distribution.Our analytic methods are then used to derive insights on how multi-server systems with prioritization compare with their single server counterparts with respect to response time.

The resulting computational scheme is easy to implement and numerically stable. We also discuss a method to determine the roots by applying successive substitutions to a fixed point equation. We outline under which conditions this method works, and compare these conditions with those needed for the Fourier series representation.

We derive first and second moments of the service time of customers in system using first step analysis to obtain an insight on the service process. In fact, we obtain an intriguing result in that the moments of service time actually depend on the arrival process! We also show that the mean service rate is not the reciprocal of the mean service time.Further, since it is not possible to obtain a closed form expression for the queue length distribution, we use matrix geometric methods to compute performance measures such as average queue length and waiting time. We apply the method of large deviations to obtain tail distributions of the workload in the queue using the concept of effective bandwidth.

In this paper we consider the issues that arise when calculating performance measures like the mean queue length and the fraction of time a station is empty.It is assumed that jobs arrive at the first station according to a Poisson process and require service at both stations before leaving the system. The amount of work that a job requires at each of the stations is an independent, exponentially distributed random variable. When both stations are nonempty, the total service capacity is shared among the stations according to fixed proportions. When one of the stations becomes empty, the total service capacity is given to the nonempty station.We study the two-dimensional Markov process representing the numbers of jobs at the two stations. The problem of finding the generating function of the stationary distribution can be reduced to two different Riemann-Hilbert boundary value problems, where both problems yield a complete analytical solution.

The server is unavailable for occasional intervals of time called vacations, and when it is available, customers are served in groups of fixed size B. For this class of queues, we show that the vector probability generating function of the stationary queue length distribution is factored into two terms, one of which is the vector probability generating function of the conditional queue length distribution given that the server is on vacation.

Because we need iterations to calculate the steady state probabilities, the only error arises from choosing a finite number of matrix iterations. Based on these probabilities, we can derive approximations for a wide range of relevant performance characteristics, such as the moments of the number of customers of a certain type in the system en the expected postponement time for each customer class.

Neither queue is equipped with dedicated servers. Instead, we consider three scenarios for the fluctuations of workforce level. In the first, a decision-maker can increase and decrease the capacity as is deemed appropriate; the unrestricted case. In the other two cases, workers arrive randomly and can be rejected or allocated to either station. In one case the number of workers can then be reduced (the controlled capacity reduction case). In the other they leave randomly (the uncontrolled capacity reduction case). All servers are capable of working collaboratively on a single job and can work at either station as long as they remain in the system. We show in each scenario that all workers should be allocated to one queue or the other (never split between queues) and that they should serve exhaustively at one of the queues depending on the direction of an inequality. This extends previous studies on flexible systems to the case where the capacity varies over time. We then show in the unrestricted case that the optimal number of workers to have in the system is non-decreasing in the number of customers in either queue.",2005,2005-10,51,2-Jan,135-171,"Kaufman, David L.

This paper considers single-server queues with several customer classes. Arrivals of customers are governed by the underlying continuous-time Markov chain with finite states. The distribution of the amount of work brought into the system on arrival is assumed to be general, which may differ with different classes. Further, the service speed depends on the state of the underlying Markov chain. We first show that given such a queue, we can construct the corresponding new queue with constant service speed by means of a change of time scale, and the time-average quantities of interest in the original queue are given in terms of those in the new queue. Next we characterize the joint distribution of the length of a busy period and the number of customers served during the busy period in the original queue.

Using the contraction mapping principle, we demonstrate the existence and uniqueness of a solution to the integral equation. Then we provide asymptotical analysis as well as tight bounds for the expected response time conditioned on the service time. In particular, the asymptotics for large service times depends only on the first moment of the service time distribution and on the first two moments of the batch size distribution. That is, similarly to the Processor-Sharing queue with single arrivals, in the Processor-Sharing queue with batch arrivals the expected conditional response time is finite even when the service time distribution has infinite second moment.

The admittance of customers typically depends on the amount of work found upon arrival in addition to its own service requirement. Typical examples are the finite dam, systems with customer impatience and queues regulated by the complete rejection discipline. Our study is motivated by queueing scenarios where the arrival rate and/or speed of the server depends on the amount of work present, like production systems and the Internet.First, we compare the steady-state distribution of the workload in two finite-buffer models, in which the ratio of arrival and service speed is equal. Second, we find an explicit expression for the cycle maximum in an M/G/1 queue with workload-dependent arrival and service rate.

The connectivity of the server to each queue is randomly modulated, taking values 1 (connected) or 0 (severed). At any given time, only the currently connected queues may receive service. A key issue is how to schedule the server on the connected queues in order to maximize the system throughput. We investigate two dynamic schedules, which are shown to stabilize the system under the highest possible traffic load, by scheduling the server on the connected queue of maximum backlog (workload or job number). They are analyzed under stationary ergodic traffic flows and connectivity modulation. The results also extend to the more general case of random server rate.We then investigate the dynamics of acyclic (feed-forward) queueing networks with nodes of the previous type. Their links (connectivities) are stochastically modulated, inducing fluctuating network topologies. We focus on the issue of network throughput and show that it is maximized by simple node server schedules.

QNA calculates approximate congestion measures for a network of queues. The variant proposed here allows us to relax QNA‚Äôs assumption that certain counts of events in the network are uncorrelated. Following QNA, the network is approximated in terms of three basic operations on streams, namely, queueing, splitting and superposition, and random quantities of interest are characterized approximately by two moments. The approach differs from QNA in that instead of expressing the network operations as transformations applied to two-moment characterizations of the inputs, it expresses these operations as regression relations between counts in the output streams and the input streams. In essence, we substitute approximate regression relationships between random variables for QNA‚Äôs approximate moment relationships. This device allows us to enhance QNA‚Äôs moment relationships with information about correlations between the streams. We compare the performance of the proposed approach with QNA on a simple feed-forward network to demonstrate the need for taking account of correlation.

10.1007/s11134-005-0857-y,Relaxation Time for the Discrete D/G/1 Queue,"When queueing models are used for performance analysis of some stochastic system, it is usually assumed that the system is in steady-state. Whether or not this is a realistic assumption depends on the speed at which the system tends to its steady-state. A characterization of this speed is known in the queueing literature as relaxation time.The discrete D/G/1 queue has a wide range of applications. We derive relaxation time asymptotics for the discrete D/G/1 queue in a purely analytical way, mostly relying on the saddle point method. We present a simple and useful approximate upper bound which is sharp in case the load on the system is not very high. A sharpening of this upper bound, which involves the complementary error function, is then developed and this covers both the cases of low and high loads.For the discrete D/G/1 queue, the stationary waiting time distribution can be expressed in terms of infinite series that follow from Spitzer‚Äôs identity. These series involve convolutions of the probability distribution of a discrete random variable, which makes them suitable for computation. For practical purposes, though, the infinite series should be truncated. The relaxation time asymptotics can be applied to determine an appropriate truncation level based on a sharp estimate of the error caused by truncating.",2005,2005-05,50,1,53-80,"Janssen, A. J. E. M.

In a first step, we establish the differential system governing the conditional sojourn times probability distributions in this queue, given the number of customers in the different phases of the PH distribution at the arrival instant of a customer. This differential system is then solved by using a uniformization procedure and an exponential of matrix. The proposed algorithm precisely consists of computing this exponential with a controlled accuracy. This algorithm is then used in practical cases to investigate the impact of the variability of service times on sojourn times and the validity of the so-called reduced service rate (RSR) approximation, when service times in the different phases are highly dissymmetrical. For two-stage PH distributions, we give conjectures on the limiting behavior in terms of an M/M/1 PS queue and provide numerical illustrative examples.",2005,2005-05,50,1,109-130,"Sericola, Bruno (University of Rennes 1); Guillemin, Fabrice (Orange (France)); Boyer, Jacqueline (Orange (France))",Orange (France); University of Rennes 1,10,0,,145

We assume that the representing matrices in such MAPs are expanded in terms of matrix representations of the standard generators in the Lie algebra of the special linear group. The primary purpose of this paper is to construct an explicit solution of the time-dependent distribution and factorial moments of the number of arrival events in (0,t] of the counting process for this class of MAPs. Our construction relies on the Baker‚ÄìHausdorff lemma and the specific structure of the representing matrices. To investigate the efficiency of CPU usage with the explicit solution, we have conducted numerical experiments on computing the time-dependent distribution of the counting process through the explicit solution and uniformization-based method. We show that the CPU times required to compute the time-dependent distribution of the number of arrival events in (0,t] through the explicit solution have little sensitivity to t, while the consumption of CPU times with the uniformization-based method becomes greater as t increases. For illustrative purposes, we present a system performance analysis of a queueing system for possible use in automatic call distribution (ACD) systems. As an application of the explicit solution, we use it to express the waiting time distribution of the queueing system.

These e servers keep taking vacations until the number of customers in the system is at least N at a vacation completion instant, then the e servers return to serve the queue again.

The distinction from classical results is that the sequence of switchover times from each of the queues need not be i.i.d. nor independent from each other; each sequence is merely required to form a stationary ergodic sequence. With the help of stochastic recursive equations explicit expressions are derived for a number of performance measures, most notably for the average delay of a customer and the average queue lengths under different service disciplines. With these expressions a comparison is made between the service disciplines and the influence of correlation is studied. Finally, through a number of examples it is shown that the correlation can significantly increase the mean delay and the average queue lengths indicating that the correlation between switchover times should not be ignored. This has important implications for communication systems in which a common communication channel is shared amongst various users and where the time between consecutive data transfers is correlated (for example in ad-hoc networks).

Next we show the applicability of the general formula to queues fed by independent sources with infinite-state underlying Markov chains and discrete phase-type active periods. We then provide explicit formulas for the mean buffer contents in queues with Markovian autoregressive sources and greedy sources. Further we study two limiting cases in general settings, one is that the lengths of active periods of each source are governed by an infinite-state absorbing Markov chain, and the other is the model obtained by the limit such that the number of sources goes to infinity under an appropriate normalizing condition. As you will see, the latter limit leads to a queue with (generalized) M/G/‚àû input sources.

10.1007/s11134-006-7585-9,Sojourn time asymptotics in processor-sharing queues,"Over the past few decades, the Processor-Sharing (PS) discipline has attracted a great deal of attention in the queueing literature. While the PS paradigm emerged in the sixties as an idealization of round-robin scheduling in time-shared computer systems, it has recently captured renewed interest as a useful concept for modeling the flow-level performance of bandwidth-sharing protocols in communication networks. In contrast to the simple geometric queue length distribution, the sojourn time lacks such a nice closed-form characterization, even for exponential service requirements. In case of heavy-tailed service requirements however, there exists a simple asymptotic equivalence between the sojourn time and the service requirement distribution, which is commonly referred to as a reduced service rate approximation. In the present survey paper, we give an overview of several methods that have been developed to obtain such an asymptotic equivalence under various distributional assumptions. We outline the differences and similarities between the various approaches, discuss some connections, and present necessary and sufficient conditions for an asymptotic equivalence to hold. We also consider the generalization of the reduced service rate approximation to several extensions of the M/G/1 PS queue. In addition, we identify a relationship between the reduced service rate approximation and a queue length distribution with a geometrically decaying tail, and extend it to so-called bandwidth-sharing networks. The state-of-the-art with regard to sojourn time asymptotics in PS queues with light-tailed service requirements is also briefly described. Last, we reflect on some possible avenues for further research.",2006,2006-06,53,2-Jan,31-51,,National Research Institute for Mathematics and Computer Science; Eindhoven University of Technology,35,4,3,200

The approach is based on parametric characterization of the traffic processes (arrival and departure) in the network and uses two-moment approximations to estimate performance measures at individual stations. We derive traffic flow constraints that are particular to closed queuing networks with synchronization stations and use these to establish relationships between the parameters characterizing arrival and departure processes at the stations in the network. The resultant set of non-linear equations is solved to estimate network performance measures. Numerical studies show that the approach is not only fast but also reasonably accurate when compared to simulation. These studies also provide insights with respect to the impact of different types of variability on the performance of a kanban system. This work also provides a fundamental building block that can be used in the analysis of multi-stage kanban systems.",2006,2006-10,54,2,141-162,"Krishnamurthy, Ananth (Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute); Suri, Rajan (University of Wisconsin‚ÄìMadison)",University of Wisconsin‚ÄìMadison; Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute,31,3,,223

The development of analytically tractable models to determine their performance is vitally important. The discrete time batch Markovian arrival process (DBMAP) has been widely used to model the source behavior of data traffic, while phase-type (PH) distribution has been extensively applied to model the service time. This paper focuses on the computation of the DBMAP/PH/1 queueing system with priorities, in which the arrival process is considered to be a DBMAP with two priority levels and the service time obeys a discrete PH distribution. Such a queueing model has potential in performance evaluation of computer networks such as video transmission over wireless networks and priority scheduling in ATM or TDMA networks.

Jobs arrive according to a Poisson process, with their processing times following a discrete distribution with finite support. The processing time of a job is known on arrival and may be used in the routing decision. We propose a policy consisting of multi-layered round robin routing followed by shortest remaining processing time scheduling at the servers. This policy is shown to have a heavy traffic limit that is identical to one in which there is a single queue (no routing) and optimal heavy traffic scheduling. In light traffic, we show that the performance of this policy is worse than round robin routing followed by shortest remaining processing time scheduling. We also quantify the difference between round robin and multi-layered round robin routing, which in turn yields insights on the relative importance of routing versus (local) scheduling in such systems.",2006,2006-08,53,4,177-188,"Down, Douglas G.

We first show that for certain queueing systems, the average sojourn time of requests depends much more weakly on the load œÅ than the commonly observed 1/(1‚àíœÅ) dependence for most queueing policies. For example, we show that for an M/G/1 system under the preemptive Shortest Job First (pSJF) policy, the average sojourn time varies as log (1/(1‚àíœÅ)) with load for a certain class of distributions.We observe that such results hold even for more restricted policies. We give some examples of non-preemptive policies and policies that do not use the knowledge of job sizes while scheduling, where the dependence of average sojourn time on load is significantly better than 1/(1‚àíœÅ). Similar results hold even for very simple non-preemptive threshold based policies that partition all the jobs into two job classes based on a fixed threshold and do FIFO within each class.

The goal is to design well-grounded and tractable scheduling policies that nearly minimize expected total discounted or long-run average cost. New dynamic index policies are introduced, awarding higher priority to classes with larger index values, where a class‚Äô index measures the marginal productivity of work at its current state. The results are obtained by deploying the work-cost analysis approach to marginal productivity indices (MPIs) for restless bandits developed by the author, which is extended to the bias criterion. The MPI furnishes new insights: for a loss-sensitive class, it is a decreasing function of the number of empty buffer spaces, independent of the buffer size; for a delay-sensitive class, it is a decreasing function of the queue length. Such opposite orderings show that preventive work is more valuable than reactive work for the latter classes, whereas the opposite holds for the former. The results of a computational study on two-class instances are reported, shedding light on how the MPI policy‚Äôs relative performance varies with each parameter. Parameter ranges are thus identified where the MPI policy is near optimal, and substantially outperforms conventional benchmark policies.",2006,2006-12,54,4,281-312,"Ni√±o-Mora, Jos√© (Carlos III University of Madrid)",Carlos III University of Madrid,16,3,,86

We assume that the servers are cross-trained (so that they can work at several different stations) and that two or more servers can cooperate on the same job. For such a system, we provide sufficient conditions on the service times and sizes of the input and output buffers at the pooled station under which pooling will decrease the departure time of each job from the system (and hence increase the system throughput). We also show that pooling decreases the total number of jobs in the system at any given time and the sojourn time of each job in the system if the departure time of each job from the system is decreased by pooling and there is an arrival stream at the first station. Moreover, we provide sufficient conditions under which pooling will improve the holding cost of each job in the system incurred before any given time, and extend our results to closed tandem lines and to queueing networks with either a more general blocking mechanism or probabilistic routing. Finally, we present a numerical study aimed at quantifying the improvements in system performance obtained through pooling and at understanding which stations should be pooled to achieve the maximum benefit.

For each user, the state of the channel evolves over time according to an exogenous continuous-time Markov chain (CTMC), which affects the quality of transmission. The traffic for each user, arriving at the central controller, is modeled as a finite-buffer Markovian queue with adjustable service rates. That is, for each user data packets arrive to the central controller according to a Poisson process and packet size is exponentially distributed; an arriving packet is dropped if the associated buffer is full, which results in degradation of quality of service. The controller forwards (downlink) the arriving packets to the corresponding user according to an optimally chosen transmission rate from a fixed set Ai of available values for each user i, depending on the backlog in the system and the channel state of all users. The objective is to maximize quality of service subject to an upper bound on the long-run average power consumption. We show that the optimal transmission rate for each user is solely a function of his own packet queue length and channel state; the dependence among users is captured through a penalty rate. Further, we explicitly characterize the optimal transmission rate for each user.",2006,2007-01,55,1,41-69,"Ata, Barƒ±≈ü (Northwestern University); Zachariadis, Konstantinos E.

The key result is that the operation of a 3-class priority queue can be mimicked by means of an alternate system that is composed of a single stack and queue. The evolution of this alternate system is reduced to a tree-like Markov process, the solution of which is realized through matrix analytic methods.

In the present paper, we turn the attention to networks without blocking. To this end, we consider a set of ‚Äúinsensitive‚Äù dynamic load balancing schemes preserving the structure of Whittle networks in the case of infinite buffers and examine their efficiency. Using Hausdorff‚Äôs theorem, we prove that the optimal insensitive schemes are static in this case, i.e., routing decisions do not depend on the current state of the queues. On the other hand, simulations show that the performance of static policies is generally much worse than that of ‚Äúnon balanced‚Äù sensitive dynamic policies. This demonstrates that strict insensitivity and efficiency may be incompatible objectives for networks with dynamic load balancing in case of infinite buffers.",2006,2006-11,54,3,193-202,"Jonckheere, M.

We propose a general model in which both service times and repair times at each machine are i.i.d.with some general distribution. Routing decisions take account of queue lengths, machine states (up or down), the elapsed processing times of jobs in service and the times to date of any machine repairs in progress. We develop an approach to machine calibration which yields a machine index which is a function of all of the preceding information. The heuristic which routes all tasks to the machine of current smallest index performs outstandingly well. The approach of the paper is flexible and is capable of yielding strongly performing routing policies for a range of variants of the basic model.

After completion of service, customers are required to leave the system in their order of arrival, thus incurring an additional resequencing delay. We are interested in minimizing the end-to-end delay (including time at the resequencing buffer) experienced by arriving customers. To that end we establish the optimality of the Round‚ÄìRobin routing assignment in two asymptotic regimes, namely heavy and light traffic: In heavy traffic, the Round‚ÄìRobin customer assignment is shown to achieve the smallest (in the increasing convex stochastic ordering) end-to-end delay amongst all routing policies operating without queue state information.

10.1007/s11134-007-9044-7,Towards a unifying theory on branching-type polling systems in heavy traffic,"For a broad class of polling models the evolution of the system at specific embedded polling instants is known to constitute a multi-type branching process (MTBP) with immigration. In this paper it is shown that for this class of polling models the vector that describes the state of the system at these polling instants, say X=(X1,‚Ä¶,XM), satisfies the following heavy-traffic behavior (under mild assumptions): where Œ≥ is a known M-dimensional vector, Œì(Œ±,Œº) has a gamma-distribution with known parameters Œ± and Œº, and where œÅ is the load of the system. This general and powerful result is shown to lead to exact‚Äîand in many cases even closed-form‚Äîexpressions for the Laplace-Stieltjes Transform (LST) of the complete asymptotic queue-length and waiting-time distributions for a broad class of branching-type polling models that includes many well-studied polling models policies as special cases. The results generalize and unify many known results on the waiting times in polling systems in heavy traffic, and moreover, lead to new exact results for classical polling models that have not been observed before. To demonstrate the usefulness of the results, we derive closed-form expressions for the LST of the waiting-time distributions for models with cyclic globally-gated polling regimes, and for cyclic polling models with general branching-type service policies. As a by-product, our results lead to a number of asymptotic insensitivity properties, providing new fundamental insights in the behavior of polling models.",2007,2007-09,57,1,29-46,"van der Mei, R.

The state process corresponding to the queue-length process is given by a stochastic differential equation which reflects at the origin. The controller can choose the drift coefficient which represents the service rate and the buffer size b>0. When the queue length reaches b, the new customers are rejected and this incurs a penalty. There are three types of costs involved: A ‚Äúcontrol cost‚Äù related to the dynamically controlled service rate, a ‚Äúcongestion cost‚Äù which depends on the queue length and a ‚Äúrejection penalty‚Äù for the rejection of the customers. We consider the problem of minimizing long-term average cost, which is also known as the ergodic cost criterion. We obtain an optimal drift rate (i.e. an optimal service rate) as well as the optimal buffer size b*>0. When the buffer size b>0 is fixed and where there is no congestion cost, this problem is similar to the work in Ata, Harrison and Shepp (Ann. Appl. Probab. 15, 1145‚Äì1160, 2005).

In the last few years, applied probabilists have achieved considerable success in developing efficient algorithms for some such simple but fundamental tail probabilities. Usually, unbiased importance sampling estimators of such tail probabilities are developed and it is proved that these estimators are asymptotically efficient or even possess the desirable bounded relative error property. In this paper, as an illustration, we consider a simple tail probability involving geometric sums of heavy tailed random variables. This is useful in estimating the probability of large delays in M/G/1 queues. In this setting we develop an unbiased estimator whose relative error decreases to zero asymptotically. The key idea is to decompose the probability of interest into a known dominant component and an unknown small component. Simulation then focuses on estimating the latter ‚Äòresidual‚Äô probability. Here we show that the existing conditioning methods or importance sampling methods are not effective in estimating the residual probability while an appropriate combination of the two estimates it with bounded relative error. As a further illustration of the proposed ideas, we apply them to develop an estimator for the probability of large delays in stochastic activity networks that has an asymptotically zero relative error.",2007,2007-11,57,3-Feb,115-127,"Juneja, S.

10.1007/s11134-007-9020-2,On balking from an empty queue,"The intuition while observing the economy of queueing systems, is that one‚Äôs motivation to join the system, decreases with its level of congestion. Here we present a queueing model where sometimes the opposite is the case. The point of departure is the standard first-come first-served single server queue with Poisson arrivals. Customers commence service immediately if upon their arrival the server is idle. Otherwise, they are informed if the queue is empty or not. Then, they have to decide whether to join or not. We assume that the customers are homogeneous and when they consider whether to join or not, they assess their queueing costs against their reward due to service completion. As the whereabouts of customers interact, we look for the (possibly mixed) join/do not join Nash equilibrium strategy, a strategy that if adopted by all, then under the resulting steady-state conditions, no one has any incentive not to follow it oneself. We show that when the queue is empty then depending on the service distribution, both ‚Äòavoid the crowd‚Äô (ATC) and ‚Äòfollow the crowd‚Äô (FTC) scenarios (as well as none-of-the-above) are possible. When the queue is not empty, the situation is always that of ATC.

When the fluid level hits zero, it instantaneously jumps to a predetermined positive level q. At the jump epoch the environment state can undergo an instantaneous transition. Between two consecutive jumps of the fluid level the environment process behaves like a continuous time Markov chain (CTMC) with finite state space. We develop methods to compute the limiting distribution of the bivariate process (buffer level, environment state). We also study a special case where the environment state does not change when the fluid level jumps.

Furthermore, we allow interarrival and service times to have general distributions. For networks with two stations we derive necessary and sufficient conditions for positive Harris recurrence of the network process. These conditions involve only the mean values of the network primitives. We also provide counterexamples showing that more information on distributions and tie-breaking probabilities is needed for networks with more than two stations, in order to characterize the stability of such systems. However, if the routing probabilities in the network satisfy a certain homogeneity condition, then we show that the stability behavior can be explicitly determined, again using the mean value parameters of the network.

Overcoming this, we developed a generic and accurate loss performance model for a degenerate GI/G/1 buffer in discrete time, that yields results instantly for any constellation of burst sizes, inter-arrival times, granularity, load and buffer size.

It differs from conventional queueing models in that the server not only serves customers, but also performs acquisition of new customers. The server has to divide its energy between both activities. The number of newly acquired customers is uncertain, and the effect of the server‚Äôs acquisition efforts can only be seen after some fixed time period Œ¥ (delay).

The acquisition queue constitutes a (Œ¥+1)-dimensional Markov chain. The limiting queue length distribution is derived in terms of its probability generating function, and an exact expression for the mean queue length is given. For large values of Œ¥ the numerical procedures needed for calculating the mean queue length become computationally cumbersome. We therefore complement the exact expression with a fluid approximation.

One of the key features of the acquisition queue is that the server performs more acquisition when the queue is small. Together with the delay, this causes the queue length process to show a strongly cyclic behavior. We propose and investigate several ways of planning the acquisition efforts. In particular, we propose an acquisition scheme that is designed specifically to reduce the cyclic behavior of the queue length process.",2007,2007-08,56,4-Mar,229-240,"Denteneer, D.

For this class of reflected jump-diffusion processes sufficient conditions for the existence of a product-form stationary density and an ergodic characterization of the stationary distribution are provided. Moreover, such stationary density is characterized in terms of semi-martingale local times at the boundaries and it is shown to be continuous and bounded.

Flows arrive according to a Poisson process, and when n flows are present, each of them transmits traffic into the queue at a rate c/(n+1), where the remaining c/(n+1) is used to serve the queue. We assume exponentially distributed flow sizes, so that the queue under consideration can be regarded as a system with Markov fluid input. The rationale behind studying this queue lies in ad hoc networks: bottleneck links have roughly this type of sharing policy. We consider four performance metrics: (i)¬†the stationary workload of the queue, (ii)¬†the queueing delay, i.e., the delay of a ‚Äòpacket‚Äô (a fluid particle) that arrives at the queue at an arbitrary point in time, (iii)¬†the flow transfer delay, i.e., the time elapsed between arrival of a flow and the epoch that all its traffic has been put into the queue, and (iv)¬†the sojourn time, i.e., the flow transfer time increased by the time it takes before the last fluid particle of the flow is served.

The goal is to minimize the total holding cost. The problem is shown to be polynomial if a job type can be divided between the pooling centers, and NP-hard if dividing job types is not possible. When there are two servers and jobs cannot be divided, we demonstrate that the two pooling center configuration is rarely optimal.

The common rate function in this family also appears in a large deviation principle for the tail probabilities of an integrated Ornstein‚ÄìUhlenbeck process.

This model is primarily motivated by the problem of efficient scheduling of transmissions of multiple data flows sharing a wireless channel.We address the following problem of controlling large deviations of the queues: find a scheduling rule, which is optimal in the sense of maximizing 0.1where Qi is the length of the i-th queue in a stationary regime, and ai>0 are parameters. Thus, we seek to maximize the minimum of the exponential decay rates of the tails of distributions of weighted queue lengths aiQi. We give a characterization of the upper bound on (0.1) under any scheduling rule, and of the lower bound on (0.1) under the exponential (EXP) rule. We prove that the two bounds match, thus proving optimality of the EXP rule. The EXP rule is very parsimonious in that it does not require any ‚Äúpre-computation‚Äù of its parameters, and uses only current state of the queues and of the server.The EXP rule is not invariant with respect to scaling of the queues, which complicates its analysis in the large deviations regime.

The third problem involves a multi-server system that can be used to analyze a call center offering a call-back option to its impatient customers. Here, customers requesting to be called back are considered to be the low-priority class.

Under those assumptions, a large deviations principle (LDP) is conjectured for the stationary distribution of Z, and we recapitulate the cases for which it has been rigorously justified.

In the Halfin-Whitt regime, it is well known that this random variable converges to the supremum of a Gaussian random walk. This paper develops methods that yield more accurate results in terms of series expansions and inequalities for the probability of an empty queue, and the mean and variance of the queue length distribution. This quantifies the relationship between the limiting system and the queue with a small or moderate number of servers. The main idea is to view the M/D/s queue through the prism of the Gaussian random walk: as for the standard Gaussian random walk, we provide scalable series expansions involving terms that include the Riemann zeta function.",2008,2008-04,58,4,261,"Janssen, A.

An arriving customer joins the queue and stays until served if and only if the system workload is no more than a fixed level at the time of his arrival. We begin by considering a fluid model where the buffer content changes at a rate determined by an external stochastic process with finite state space. We derive systems of first-order linear differential equations for the mean and LST (Laplace-Stieltjes Transform) of the busy period in this model and solve them explicitly. We obtain the mean and LST of the busy period in the M/PH/1 queue with workload-dependent balking as a special limiting case of this fluid model.

Similarly to the MVA algorithm for constant-rate queues, CMVA performs operations in terms of mean quantities only, i.e., queue-lengths, throughput, response times. Numerical stability derives from a new version of the MVA arrival theorem for load-dependent models which is expressed in terms of mean queue-lengths instead of marginal probabilities. The formula is obtained by the analysis of the conditional state spaces which describe network equilibrium as seen by jobs during their residence times at queues.

When the server becomes idle, he departs for a single vacation of an arbitrarily distributed length. The arrival process is assumed to be Poisson and all service times are arbitrarily distributed. For such a system the stability conditions and the system state probabilities are investigated both in a transient and in a steady state. A stochastic decomposition result is also presented.

Over the years, much research has been devoted to developing the best scheduling policies to optimize the various performance metrics of interest. These policies have mostly originated from the well-known MaxWeight discipline, which at any point in time switches the system into the service mode possessing ‚Äúmaximal matching‚Äù with the system state (e.g., queue-length, workload, etc.). However, for simplicity it is often assumed that the switching times between service modes are ‚Äúnegligible‚Äù‚Äîbut this proves to be impractical in some applications. In this study, we propose a new scheduling strategy (called the Dynamic Cone Policy) for SPS, which includes substantial service-mode switching times. The goal is to maximize throughput and maintain system stability under fairly mild stochastic assumptions. For practical purposes, an extended scheduling strategy (called the Practical Dynamic Cone Policy) is developed to reduce the computational complexity of the Dynamic Cone Policy and at the same time mitigate job delay. A simulation study shows that the proposed practical policy clearly outperforms another throughput-maximizing policy called BatchAdapt, both in terms of the average and the 95th percentile of job delay for various types of input traffic.",2008,2008-10,60,2-Jan,87-109,"Hung, Ying-Chao (National Central University); Chang, Chun-Chieh (National Central University)",National Central University,6,1,,74

Examples with up to six customer classes, using Poisson arrival and service processes, are presented.

This problem is motivated by a model of two-stage inspection in which finitely many items come to a first stage for screening. Items failing first-stage inspection go to a second stage to be examined further. Assuming that arrivals at the second stage can be regarded as an independent thinning of the departures from the first stage, the arrival process at the second stage is approximately a terminating Poisson process. If the failure probabilities are not constant, then this Poisson process will be nonhomogeneous. The last departure time from an Mt/G/‚àû queue with a terminating arrival process serves as a remarkably tractable approximation, which is appropriate when there are ample inspection resources at the second stage. For this model, the last departure time is a Poisson random maximum, so that it is possible to give exact expressions and develop useful approximations based on extreme-value theory.",2008,2008-02,58,2,77-104,"Goldberg, David Alan (Massachusetts Institute of Technology); Whitt, Ward (Columbia University)",Columbia University; Massachusetts Institute of Technology,5,0,,378

For a sequence of cyclic networks whose asymptotic profile exists, we compute upper and lower bounds for the limit points of the sequence of throughputs as functions of the limiting customer-to-node ratio.

Relying predominantly on probabilistic argumentation, the steady-state buffer content of both queues is determined (in terms of its Laplace transform). Interpreting the buffer content of the second queue in terms of busy periods of the first queue, the (exact) tail asymptotics of the distribution of the second queue are found. Two regimes can be distinguished: a first in which the state of the first queue (that is, being empty or not) hardly plays a role, and a second in which it explicitly does.

The problem is often referred to as buffer sharing in the literature. From the linear programming (LP) formulation of the continuous-time Markov decision process (MDP), we construct a hierarchy of increasingly stronger LP relaxations where the hierarchy levels equal the number of job classes. Each relaxation in the hierarchy is obtained by projecting the original achievable performance region onto a polytope of simpler structure. We propose a heuristic policy for admission control, which is based on the theory of Marginal Productivity Index (MPI) and the Lagrangian decomposition of the first order LP relaxation. The dual of the relaxed buffer space constraint in the first order LP relaxation is used as a proxy to the cost of buffer space. Given that each of the decomposed queueing admission control problems satisfies the indexability condition, the proposed heuristic accepts a new arrival if there is enough buffer space left and the MPI of the current job class is greater than the incurred cost of buffer usage.

In particular, we establish an upper limit of the long-run loss ratio of the workload in the queue. Our results would reveal useful tools to evaluate the performance of queuing systems when information about input processes in a fine timescale is not available.",2008,2008-10,60,2-Jan,153,"Shioda, Shigeo (Chiba University)",Chiba University,0,0,,47

10.1007/s11134-009-9144-7,Flow-level performance and capacity of wireless networks with user mobility,"The performance evaluation of wireless networks is severely complicated by the specific features of radio communication, such as highly variable channel conditions, interference issues, and possible hand-offs among base stations. The latter elements have no natural counterparts in wireline scenarios, and create a need for novel performance models that account for the impact of these characteristics on the service rates of users.Motivated by the above issues, we review several models for characterizing the capacity and evaluating the flow-level performance of wireless networks carrying elastic data transfers. We first examine the flow-level performance and stability of a wide family of so-called Œ±-fair channel-aware scheduling strategies. We establish that these disciplines provide maximum stability, and describe how the special case of the Proportional Fair policy gives rise to a Processor-Sharing model with a state-dependent service rate. Next we turn attention to a network of several base stations with inter-cell interference. We derive both necessary and sufficient stability conditions and construct lower and upper bounds for the flow-level performance measures. Lastly we investigate the impact of user mobility that occurs on a slow timescale and causes possible hand-offs of active sessions. We show that the mobility tends to increase the capacity region, both in the case of globally optimal scheduling and local Œ±-fair scheduling. It is additionally demonstrated that the capacity and user throughput improve with lower values of the fairness index¬†Œ±.",2009,2009-12,63,4-Jan,131,,Orange (France); Eindhoven University of Technology; Microsoft Research (United Kingdom),48,4,,693

This queueing system is modeled as a two-dimensional embedded Markov chain which has an M/G/1-type transition probability matrix. Using the matrix analytic method, we obtain the distribution for the stationary queue length at departure epochs. Then, based on the classical vacation decomposition in the M/G/1 queue, we derive a conditional stochastic decomposition result. The joint distribution for the stationary queue length and service status at the arbitrary epoch is also obtained by analyzing the semi-Markov process. Furthermore, we provide the stationary waiting time and busy period analysis.

It is well established that in a number of these problems, there is an optimal policy that can be described by a few parameters. From a design point of view, it is useful to understand how such an optimal policy varies with changes in system parameters. We present a general framework to investigate the policy implications of the changes in system parameters by using event-based dynamic programming. In this framework, the control model is represented by a number of common operators, and the effect of system parameters on the structured optimal policy is analyzed for each individual operator. Whenever a queueing control problem can be modeled by these operators, the effects of system parameters on the optimal policy follow from this analysis.",2009,2009-04,61,4,273-304,"√áil, Eren Ba≈üar (Northwestern University); √ñrmeci, E.

In this paper we prove that no approximation based on only the first two moments can be accurate for all job size distributions, and we provide a lower bound on the inapproximability ratio, which we refer to as ‚Äúthe gap.‚Äù This is the first such result in the literature to address ‚Äúthe gap.‚Äù The proof technique behind this result is novel as well and combines mean value analysis, sample path techniques, scheduling, regenerative arguments, and asymptotic estimates.

Using a recently developed game/subsolution approach, we construct simple and efficient state-dependent importance sampling schemes for simulating buffer overflows in stable open Jackson networks.

10.1007/s11134-009-9153-6,A stochastic fluid model for an ad hoc mobile network,"In conventional mobile telephone networks, users communicate directly with a base station, via which their call is transferred to the recipient. In an ad hoc mobile network, there is no base-station infrastructure and users need to communicate between themselves, either directly if they are close enough, or via transit nodes if they are not.A number of interesting questions immediately arise in the modeling of ad hoc mobile networks. One that has received attention in the literature concerns how to encourage users to act as transit nodes for calls that they are not partaking in. Solutions to this problem have involved each user maintaining a ‚Äòcredit balance‚Äô which is increased by forwarding transit calls and decreased by transmitting one‚Äôs own calls.A second question concerns the ‚Äòamount of resource‚Äô that a network needs in order to be able to operate with a reasonable quality of service. We shall consider this question by modeling each user‚Äôs battery energy and credit balance as fluids, the rate of increase or decrease of which is modulated by the network occupancy. This results in a network of stochastic fluid models, each modulated by the same background process.In this paper, we shall assume that there is no bound on the energy or the credit that a user‚Äôs handset can accumulate. Using this model, we can calculate the critical rates of recharge that are necessary and sufficient to guarantee that no calls are lost. For recharge rates less than the critical values, we propose a reduced-load approach to the analysis of the network.",2009,2009-12,63,4-Jan,109,"Latouche, G.

10.1007/s11134-009-9122-0,The power saving mechanism with binary exponential traffic indications in the IEEE 802.16e/m,"In IEEE 802.16e (air interface standard for MWiMAX) and IEEE 802.16m (evolution of MWiMAX for IMT-Advanced), power saving is one of the important issues for the battery-powered mobile stations (MSs). According to IEEE 802.16e standard, when an MS switches from awake mode to sleep mode, the MS is required to send a sleep request (MOB-SLP-REQ) message and to receive a sleep response (MOB-SLP-RSP) message. In this paper we propose a new sleep mode scheme, called the power saving mechanism with binary exponential traffic indications. This sleep mode scheme omits MOB-SLP-REQ/RSP messages and has a traffic indication (TRF-IND) interval as a main system parameter, applying the truncated binary exponential increasing method for its length. The proposed scheme in this paper is quite well aligned with the design policy of sleep mode in discussion at IEEE 802.16m in¬†the sense that it tries to minimize the overhead for the state transition between awake mode and sleep mode, and hence it can reduce the delay due to the state transition and enhance the power saving efficiency. We present a mathematical analysis for the proposed scheme and investigate its performance. As performance measures, we provide the sleep interval ratio, the average power consumption, and the mean delay. Using the analytical results, the system parameters such as the initial TRF-IND interval and the maximum binary exponent for TRF-IND intervals can be optimized while satisfying the QoS constraint on the mean delay. The numerical results show that the proposed scheme consumes less energy than the power saving class of type I in the IEEE 802.16e standard.",2009,2009-07,62,3,197-227,"Hwang, Eunju (Korea University); Kim, Kyung Jae (Korea University); Son, Jung Je (Samsung (South Korea)); Choi, Bong Dae (Korea University; Korea University)",Samsung (South Korea); Korea University,21,1,,239

A complete characterization of the regions of system parameters for exact tail asymptotics is obtained through analysis of generating functions. This characterization has never before been completed. It is interesting to note that the exact tail asymptotics along the high-priority queue direction is of a new form that does not fall within the three types of exact tail asymptotics characterized by various methods for this type of two-dimensional system reported in the literature.

The paper first presents a necessary and sufficient condition for stability, and subsequently analyzes the joint queue-length distribution via an embedded Markov chain approach.

We consider three main regimes: Exhaustive, Gated, and Globally-Gated. Two polling procedures are analyzed: (i) cyclic and (ii) probabilistic. Under steady-state, we derive the Laplace‚ÄìStieltjes transform (LST), mean, and second moment of the amount of flow at each queue at polling instants, as well as at an arbitrary moment. We further calculate the LST and mean of the ‚Äúwaiting time‚Äù of a drop at each queue and derive expressions for the mean total load in the system for the various service regimes. Finally, we explore optimal switching procedures.",2009,2009-12,63,4-Jan,401,"Czerniak, Omer (Tel Aviv University); Yechiali, Uri (Tel Aviv University; Afeka College of Engineering)",Afeka College of Engineering; Tel Aviv University,11,1,3,139

10.1007/s11134-009-9117-x,Improved approximations for the Erlang loss model,"Stochastic loss networks are often very effective models for studying the random dynamics of systems requiring simultaneous resource possession. Given a stochastic network and a multi-class customer workload, the classical Erlang model renders the stationary probability that a customer will be lost due to insufficient capacity for at least one required resource type. Recently a novel family of slice methods has been proposed by Jung et al. (Proceedings of ACM SIGMETRICS conference on measurement and modeling of computer systems, pp.¬†407‚Äì418, 2008) to approximate the stationary loss probabilities in the Erlang model, and has been shown to provide better performance than the classical Erlang fixed point approximation in many regimes of interest. In this paper, we propose some new methods for loss probability calculation. We propose a refinement of the 3-point slice method of Jung et al. (Proceedings of ACM SIGMETRICS conference on measurement and modeling of computer systems, pp.¬†407‚Äì418, 2008) which exhibits improved accuracy, especially when heavily loaded networks are considered, at comparable computational cost. Next we exploit the structure of the stationary distribution to propose randomized algorithms to approximate both the stationary distribution and the loss probabilities. Whereas our refined slice method is exact in a certain scaling regime and is therefore ideally suited to the asymptotic analysis of large networks, the latter algorithms borrow from volume computation methods for convex polytopes to provide approximations for the unscaled network with error bounds as a function of the computational costs.",2009,2009-12,63,4-Jan,217,"Anselmi, J.

10.1007/s11134-009-9115-z,Mixed gated/exhaustive service in a polling model with priorities,"In this paper we consider a single-server polling system with switch-over times. We introduce a new service discipline, mixed gated/exhaustive service, that can be used for queues with two types of customers: high and low priority customers. At the beginning of a visit of the server to such a queue, a gate is set behind all customers. High priority customers receive priority in the sense that they are always served before any low priority customers. But high priority customers have a second advantage over low priority customers. Low priority customers are served according to the gated service discipline, i.e. only customers standing in front of the gate are served during this visit. In contrast, high priority customers arriving during the visit period of the queue are allowed to pass the gate and all low priority customers before the gate.We study the cycle time distribution, the waiting time distributions for each customer type, the joint queue length distribution of all priority classes at all queues at polling epochs, and the steady-state marginal queue length distributions for each customer type. Through numerical examples we illustrate that the mixed gated/exhaustive service discipline can significantly decrease waiting times of high priority jobs. In many cases there is a minimal negative impact on the waiting times of low priority customers but, remarkably, it turns out that in polling systems with larger switch-over times there can be even a positive impact on the waiting times of low priority customers.",2009,2009-12,63,4-Jan,383,"Boon, M.

10.1007/s11134-009-9119-8,Diffusion approximation for a heavily loaded multi-user wireless communication system with cooperation,"A cellular wireless communication system in which data is transmitted to multiple users over a common channel is considered. When the base stations in this system can cooperate with each other, the link from the base stations to the users can be considered a multi-user multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) downlink system. For such a system, it is known from information theory that the total rate of transmission can be enhanced by cooperation. The channel is assumed to be fixed for all transmissions over the period of interest and the ratio of anticipated average arrival rates for the users, also known as the relative traffic rate, is fixed. A packet-based model is considered where data for each user is queued at the transmit end. We consider a simple policy which, under Markovian assumptions, is known to be throughput-optimal for this coupled queueing system. Since an exact expression for the performance of this policy is not available, as a measure of performance, we establish a heavy traffic diffusion approximation. To arrive at this diffusion approximation, we use two key properties of the policy; we posit the first property as a reasonable manifestation of cooperation, and the second property follows from coordinate convexity of the capacity region. The diffusion process is a semimartingale reflecting Brownian motion (SRBM) living in the positive orthant of N-dimensional space (where N is the number of users). This SRBM has one direction of reflection associated with each of the 2N‚àí1 boundary faces, but show that, in fact, only those directions associated with the (N‚àí1)-dimensional boundary faces matter for the heavy traffic limit. The latter is likely of independent theoretical interest.",2009,2009-08,62,4,345-382,"Bhardwaj, S. (University of California, San Diego); Williams, R. J.

Customers arrive as a Poisson process and each arriving customer observes the length of the two queues and then chooses to join the queue that minimizes its expected queueing time. Assuming exponentially distributed service times, we numerically compute a Nash equilibrium in this system, and investigate the question of which server attracts the greater share of customers. If customers who arrive to find both queues empty independently choose to join each queue with probability 0.5, then we show that the server with FCFS discipline obtains a slightly greater share of the market. However, if such customers always join the same queue (say of the server with FCFS discipline) then that server attracts the greater share of customers.",2009,2009-07,62,3,243-254,"Hassin, Refael (Tel Aviv University)",Tel Aviv University,7,1,,170

The arrival rate to the secondary queue is much smaller than that to the primary queue, while the exponentially distributed service requirements have comparable parameters. The primary queue is assumed to be heavily loaded, so the processor-sharing factor for the secondary queue is assumed to be relatively small. We use singular perturbation analyses in a small parameter measuring the ratio of arrival rates, and the closeness of the system to instability. Two different regimes are analyzed, corresponding to a heavily loaded and a lightly loaded secondary queue, respectively. With suitable scaling of variables, lowest order asymptotic approximations to the joint stationary distribution of the numbers of jobs in the two queues are derived, as well as to the marginal distributions.",2009,2010-01,64,1,49-67,,,6,0,,99

With practical applications in mind, we investigate a lower bound on the value of probe separation, to obtain a satisfactory estimate in a fixed amount of time. This leads to a problem: how long does it take for an M/D/1 queue to converge to its steady state as a function of the load? We examine this problem using three independent approaches: the time until the autocovariance of the transient workload process becomes negligible; the time it takes for the first transient moment of the workload process to get close to its stationary limit; and the convergence rate of the transient workload distribution to stationarity. These approaches yield different, yet strikingly similar results. We conclude with a recommendation for the probe separation threshold, and a practical approach to obtaining an arrival rate estimate using single-packet probing.",2009,2009-04,61,4,255-272,"Novak, A.

The linear systems of PDEs describing the residual and attained sojourn times coincide for this system, which provides time reversibility including sojourn times for this system, and their minimal non-negative solution gives the LST of the sojourn time V(œÑ) of a request with required service time œÑ. For the case that the service time distribution is exponential in a neighborhood of zero, we derive a linear system of ODEs, whose minimal non-negative solution gives the LST of V(œÑ), and which yields linear systems of ODEs for the moments of V(œÑ) in the considered neighborhood of zero. Numerical results are presented for the variance of V(œÑ). In the case of an M/GI/2-PS system, the LST of V(œÑ) is given in terms of the solution of a convolution equation in the considered neighborhood of zero. For service times bounded from below, surprisingly simple expressions for the LST and variance of V(œÑ) in this neighborhood of zero are derived, which yield in particular the LST and variance of V(œÑ) in M/D/2-PS.",2009,2010-02,64,2,167-201,"Brandt, Manfred (Zuse Institute Berlin); Brandt, Andreas (Humboldt-Universit√§t zu Berlin)",Humboldt-Universit√§t zu Berlin; Zuse Institute Berlin,5,1,,77

classical circuit switch telephone networks (loss networks) andpresent-day wireless mobile networks.Performance measures of interest such as loss probabilities or throughputs can be obtained from the steady state distribution. However, while this steady state distribution has a closed product form expression in the first case (loss networks), it does not have one in the second case due to blocked (and lost) handovers. Product form approximations are therefore suggested. These approximations are obtained by a combined modification of both the state space (by a hypercubic expansion) and the transition rates (by extra redial rates). It will be shown that these product form approximations lead to upper bounds for loss probabilities andanalytic error bounds for the accuracy of the approximation for various performance measures.The proofs of these results rely upon both monotonicity results and an analytic error bound method as based on Markov reward theory. This combination and its technicalities are of interest by themselves. The technical conditions are worked out and verified for two specific applications: pure loss networks as under (i)GSM networks with fixed channel allocation as under (ii).The results are of practical interest for computational simplifications and, particularly, to guarantee that blocking probabilities do not exceed a given threshold such as for network dimensioning.",2009,2009-06,62,2-Jan,159,"Boucherie, Richard J.

10.1007/s11134-009-9139-4,Asymptotically optimal importance sampling for Jackson networks with a tree topology,"This note describes an importance sampling (IS) algorithm to estimate buffer overflows of stable Jackson networks with a tree topology. Three new measures of service capacity and traffic in Jackson networks are introduced and the algorithm is defined in their terms. These measures are effective service rate, effective utilization and effective service-to-arrival ratio of a node. They depend on the nonempty/empty states of the queues of the network. For a node with a nonempty queue, the effective service rate equals the node‚Äôs nominal service rate. For a node i with an empty queue, it is either a weighted sum of the effective service rates of the nodes receiving traffic directly from node¬†i, or the nominal service rate, whichever smaller. The effective utilization is the ratio of arrival rate to the effective service rate and the effective service-to-arrival ratio is its reciprocal. The rare overflow event of interest is the following: given that initially the network is empty, the system experiences a buffer overflow before returning to the empty state. Two types of buffer structures are considered: (1)¬†a¬†single system-wide buffer shared by all nodes, and (2)¬†each node has its own fixed size buffer. The constructed IS algorithm is asymptotically optimal, i.e., the variance of the associated estimator decays exponentially in the buffer size at the maximum possible rate. This is proved using methods from (Dupuis et al. in Ann. Appl. Probab. 17(4):1306‚Äì1346, 2007), which are based on a limit Hamilton‚ÄìJacobi‚ÄìBellman equation and its boundary conditions and their smooth subsolutions.

The behavior of the network consisting of the cumulative total arrival, cumulative idle time, and queue length developments for each node is specified by conditions which relate the network primitives to the network behavior. For a broad class of network primitives, including discrete customer and fluid models, a network behavior exists, but need not be unique. Nevertheless, the mapping from network primitives to the set of associated network behavior is upper semicontinuous at network primitives with continuous routing.As an application we consider a sequence of random network primitives satisfying a sample path large deviation principle. We take advantage of the partial functional set-valued upper semicontinuity in order to derive a large deviation principle for the sequence of associated random queue length processes and to identify the rate function.

Service times at either station follow the same general distribution, are independent of each other and are independent of the arrival process. The system is charged station-dependent holding costs at each station per customer per unit time. At any point in time, a decision-maker may decide to move, at a cost, some number of jobs in one queue to the other. The goals of this paper are twofold. First, we are interested in providing insights into this decision-making scenario. We do so, in the important case that the service time distribution is highly variable or simply has a heavy tail. Secondly, we propose that the savvy use of Markov decision processes can lead to easily implementable heuristics when features of the service time distribution can be captured by introducing multiple customer classes. To this end, we consider a two-station proxy for the original system, where the service times are assumed to be exponential, but of one of two classes with different rates.

10.1007/s11134-010-9183-0,Control of systems with flexible multi-server pools: a shadow routing approach,"A general model with multiple input flows (classes) and several flexible multi-server pools is considered. We propose a robust, generic scheme for routing new arrivals, which optimally balances server pools‚Äô loads, without the knowledge of the flow input rates and without solving any optimization problem. The scheme is based on Shadow routing in a virtual queueing system. We study the behavior of our scheme in the Halfin‚ÄìWhitt (or, QED) asymptotic regime, when server pool sizes and the input rates are scaled up simultaneously by a factor r growing to infinity, while keeping the system load within growth rate we call order-optimal. (ii) We show that some natural algorithms, such as MaxWeight, that guarantee stability, are not order-optimal. (iii) Under the complete resource pooling condition, we prove the diffusion limit of the arrival processes into server pools, under the Shadow routing. (We conjecture that result (iii) leads to order-optimality of the Shadow routing algorithm; a formal proof of this fact is an important subject of future work.) Simulation results demonstrate good performance and robustness of our scheme.",2010,2010-09,66,1,Jan-51,,University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign,34,4,,266
10.1007/s11134-010-9176-z,Admission control for a multi-server queue with abandonment,"In a M/M/N+M queue, when there are many customers waiting, it may be preferable to reject a new arrival rather than risk that arrival later abandoning without receiving service. On the other hand, rejecting new arrivals increases the percentage of time servers are idle, which also may not be desirable. We address these trade-offs by considering an admission control problem for a M/M/N+M queue when there are costs associated with customer abandonment, server idleness, and turning away customers. First, we formulate the relevant Markov decision process (MDP), show that the optimal policy is of threshold form, and provide a simple and efficient iterative algorithm that does not presuppose a bounded state space to compute the minimum infinite horizon expected average cost and associated threshold level. Under certain conditions we can guarantee that the algorithm provides an exact optimal solution when it stops; otherwise, the algorithm stops when a provided bound on the optimality gap is reached. Next, we solve the approximating diffusion control problem (DCP) that arises in the Halfin‚ÄìWhitt many-server limit regime. This allows us to establish that the parameter space has a sharp division. Specifically, there is an optimal solution with a finite threshold level when the cost of an abandonment exceeds the cost of rejecting a customer; otherwise, there is an optimal solution that exercises no control. This analysis also yields a convenient analytic expression for the infinite horizon expected average cost as a function of the threshold level. Finally, we propose a policy for the original system that is based on the DCP solution, and show that this policy is asymptotically optimal. Our extensive numerical study shows that the control that arises from solving the DCP achieves a very similar cost to the control that arises from solving the MDP, even when the number of servers is small.",2010,2010-07,65,3,275-323,"Ko√ßaƒüa, Ya≈üar Levent (University of Southern California); Ward, Amy R.

10.1007/s11134-010-9201-2,Dynamic control of a single-server system with abandonments,"In this paper, we discuss the dynamic server control in a two-class service system with abandonments. Two models are considered. In the first case, rewards are received upon service completion, and there are no abandonment costs (other than the lost opportunity to gain rewards). In the second, holding costs per customer per unit time are accrued, and each abandonment involves a fixed cost. Both cases are considered under the discounted or average reward/cost criterion. These are extensions of the classic scheduling question (without abandonments) where it is well known that simple priority rules hold.The contributions in this paper are twofold. First, we show that the classic c‚ÄìŒº rule does not hold in general. An added condition on the ordering of the abandonment rates is sufficient to recover the priority rule. Counterexamples show that this condition is not necessary, but when it is violated, significant loss can occur. In the reward case, we show that the decision involves an intuitive tradeoff between getting more rewards and avoiding idling. Secondly, we note that traditional solution techniques are not directly applicable. Since customers may leave in between services, an interchange argument cannot be applied. Since the abandonment rates are unbounded we cannot apply uniformization‚Äîand thus cannot use the usual discrete-time Markov decision process techniques. After formulating the problem as a continuous-time Markov decision process (CTMDP), we use sample path arguments in the reward case and a savvy use of truncation in the holding cost case to yield the results. As far as we know, this is the first time that either have been used in conjunction with the CTMDP to show structure in a queueing control problem. The insights made in each model are supported by a detailed numerical study.",2010,2011-01,67,1,63-90,"Down, Douglas G. (McMaster University); Koole, Ger (VU Amsterdam); Lewis, Mark E.

At each decision epoch the controller may adjust the service rate. Also, the controller can reject incoming customers as they arrive. The objective is to minimize long-run average costs which include: a holding cost, which is a non-decreasing function of the number of jobs in the system; a service rate cost c(x), representing the cost per unit time for servicing jobs at rate x; and a rejection cost Œ∫ for rejecting a single job.

Call centers typically consist of agents that serve customers, telephone lines, an Interactive Voice Response (IVR) unit, and a switch that routes calls to agents. In this paper we study a Markovian model for a call center with an IVR. We calculate operational performance measures, such as the probability for a busy signal and the average wait time for an agent. Exact calculations of these measures are cumbersome and they lack insight. We thus approximate the measures in an asymptotic regime known as QED (Quality and Efficiency Driven) or the Halfin‚ÄìWhitt regime, which accommodates moderate to large call centers. The approximations are both insightful and easy to apply (for up to 1000‚Äôs of agents).

In this work we study the corresponding problem in multiclass queueing networks (MQNs).In the first part of this work we consider the MQNs for which the fluid stability is valid, state-space collapse is exhibited under suitable initial conditions and a heavy traffic limit theorem holds. For such MQNs we establish that, under the assumption of the tightness of a sequence of stationary scaled workloads, the sequence converges to the stationary distribution of semimartingale reflecting Brownian motion in the heavy-traffic regime. The key to the proof is to show that state-space collapse occurs in the heavy-traffic regime in stationarity under the assumption of tightness.In the second part, using the result obtained, it is shown that such a convergence of stationary workload holds for a multiclass single-server queue with feedback routing, where the tightness is proved by the Lyapunov function method developed in (Gamarnik and Zeevi in Ann.

We show that the answer depends on whether Œª is below or above the critical value 1/4: in the former case the queues remain uniformly stochastically bounded, while otherwise they grow to infinity.The problem is essentially reduced to the behavior of the system with an infinite number of queues in tandem, which is studied using tools from interacting particle systems theory.

When the stochastic model for arrival and departure processes are completely known, then a threshold policy is known to be optimal. Many times arrival and departure processes can not be accurately modeled and controlled due to lack of sufficient calibration data or inaccurate assumptions. We prove that a threshold policy is optimal under a max‚Äìmin robust model when the uncertainty in the processes is characterized by relative entropy.

The various queues are coupled through their service rates, causing a complex dynamic interaction. Specifically, the system consists of one primary queue and several secondary queues whose service rates depend on whether the primary queue is empty or not. Conversely, the service rate of the primary queue depends on which of the secondary queues are empty.An important special case arises when the service rates satisfy a specific relationship so that the various queues form a work-conserving system. This case is, in fact, equivalent to a so-called Generalized Processor Sharing (GPS) system. GPS-based scheduling algorithms have emerged as popular mechanisms for achieving service differentiation while providing statistical multiplexing gains.We consider a heavy-traffic scenario, and assume that each of the secondary queues is underloaded when the primary queue is busy. Using a perturbation procedure, we derive the lowest-order asymptotic approximation to the joint stationary distribution of the queue lengths, in terms of a small positive parameter measuring the closeness of the system to instability. Heuristic derivations of these results are presented.We also pursue two extensions: (i) the more general work-conserving case where the service rate of a secondary queue may depend on its own length, and is a slowly varying function of the length of the primary queue; and (ii) the non-work-conserving case where the service rate of a secondary queue may depend on its own length, but not on the length of the primary queue.",2010,2010-06,65,2,135-156,,,9,0,,436

One result is that this model reflects long-range dependence of teletraffic data. We show that depending on the heaviness of the file sizes, the interarrival times and the cluster sizes we have to distinguish different growths rates for the time scale of the cumulative traffic. The mean corrected cumulative input process converges to a fractional Brownian motion in the fast growth case. However, in the intermediate and the slow growth case we can have convergence to a stable L√©vy motion or a fractional Brownian motion as well depending on the heaviness of the underlying distributions. These results are contrary to the idea that cumulative broadband network traffic converges in the slow growth case to a stable process. Furthermore, we derive the asymptotic behavior of the cluster Poisson point process which models the arrival times of data packets and the individual input process itself.",2010,2010-12,66,4,313-350,"Fasen, Vicky (Technical University of Munich)",Technical University of Munich,5,1,,122

The key idea is to measure performance at the edge of the network, and to correlate these measurements to infer the internal network performance.This paper focuses on a specific delay tomographic problem on a multicast diffusion tree, where end-to-end delays are observed at every leaf of the tree, and mean sojourn times are estimated for every node in the tree. The estimation is performed using the Maximum Likelihood Estimator (MLE) and the Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm.Using queuing theory results, we carefully justify the model we use in the case of rare probing. We then give an explicit EM implementation in the case of i.i.d.¬†exponential delays for a general tree. As we work with non-discretized delays and a full MLE, EM is known to be slow.

10.1007/s11134-010-9166-1,On L√©vy-driven vacation models with correlated busy periods and service interruptions,"This paper considers queues with server vacations, but departs from the traditional setting in two ways: (i)¬†the queueing model is driven by L√©vy processes rather than just compound Poisson processes; (ii)¬†the vacation lengths depend on the length of the server‚Äôs preceding busy period. Regarding the former point: the L√©vy process active during the busy period is assumed to have no negative jumps, whereas the L√©vy process active during the vacation is a subordinator. Regarding the latter point: where in a previous study (Boxma et al. in Probab. Eng. Inf. Sci. 22:537‚Äì555, 2008) the durations of the vacations were positively correlated with the length of the preceding busy period, we now introduce a dependence structure that may give rise to both positive and negative correlations. We analyze the steady-state workload of the resulting queueing (or: storage) system, by first considering the queue at embedded epochs (viz. the beginnings of busy periods). We show that this embedded process does not always have a proper stationary distribution, due to the fact that there may occur an infinite number of busy-vacation cycles in a finite time interval; we specify conditions under which the embedded process is recurrent. Fortunately, irrespective of whether the embedded process has a stationary distribution, the steady-state workload of the continuous-time storage process can be determined. In addition, a number of ramifications are presented.

Popular models include infinite source Poisson models, models based on aggregated renewal sequences, and models built from aggregated on‚Äìoff sources. The versions of these models with finite variance transmission rate share the following pattern: if the sources connect at a fast rate over time the cumulative statistical fluctuations are fractional Brownian motion, if the connection rate is slow the traffic fluctuations are described by a stable L√©vy motion, while the limiting fluctuations for the intermediate scaling regime are given by fractional Poisson motion. In this paper, we prove an invariance principle for the normalized cumulative workload of a network with m on‚Äìoff sources and time rescaled by a factor¬†a.

10.1007/s11134-011-9228-z,On a class of stochastic models with two-sided jumps,"In this paper a stochastic process involving two-sided jumps and a continuous downward drift is studied. In the context of ruin theory, the model can be interpreted as the surplus process of a business enterprise which is subject to constant expense rate over time along with random gains and losses. On the other hand, such a stochastic process can also be viewed as a queueing system with instantaneous work removals (or negative customers). The key quantity of our interest pertaining to the above model is (a variant of) the Gerber‚ÄìShiu expected discounted penalty function (Gerber and Shiu in N.¬†Am. Actuar. J. 2(1):48‚Äì72, 1998) from ruin theory context. With the distributions of the jump sizes and their inter-arrival times left arbitrary, the general structure of the Gerber‚ÄìShiu function is studied via an underlying ladder height structure and the use of defective renewal equations. The components involved in the defective renewal equations are explicitly identified when the upward jumps follow a combination of exponentials. Applications of the Gerber‚ÄìShiu function are illustrated in finding (i)¬†the Laplace transforms of the time of ruin, the time of recovery and the duration of first negative surplus in the ruin context; (ii)¬†the joint Laplace transform of the busy period and the subsequent idle period in the queueing context; and (iii)¬†the expected total discounted reward for a continuous payment stream payable during idle periods in a queue.",2011,2011-09,69,1,1,"Cheung, Eric C.

The single machine version of this problem in which the facility manufactures at most one product at a time to minimise inventory costs has been much studied. We achieve a major generalisation by formulating the production problem as one involving dynamic allocation of a key resource which drives the manufacture of all products under an assumption that each additional unit of resource allocated to a product achieves a diminishing return of increased production rate. A Lagrangian relaxation of the production problem induces a decomposition into K single product problems in which the production rate may be varied but is subject to charge. These reduced problems are of interest in their own right. Under mild conditions of full indexability the Lagrangian relaxation is solved by a production policy with simple index-like structure. This in turn suggests a natural index heuristic for the original production problem which performs strongly in a numerical study. The paper discusses the importance of full indexability and makes proposals for the construction of production policies involving resource idling when it fails.,2011,2011-04,67,4,333-364,"Hodge, D.

Upon arrival, a customer joins a queue according to a state-dependent policy or leaves the system immediately if it is full. No jockeying among queues is allowed. An incoming customer to a parallel queue has a general patience time dependent on that queue after which he/she must depart from the system immediately. Parallel queues are of two types: type 1, wherein the impatience mechanism acts on the waiting time; or type 2, a single server queue wherein the impatience acts on the sojourn time. We prove a key result, namely, that the state process of the system in the long run converges in distribution to a well-defined Markov process. Closed-form solutions for the probability density function of the virtual waiting time of a queue of type 1 or the offered sojourn time of a queue of type 2 in a given state are derived which are, interestingly, found to depend only on the local state of the queue.

Any connection alternates between being OFF (idle) or ON (active, with data to transmit), and evolves in a way depending only on its class and the state of the network, in particular for the routes it uses among the network nodes to transmit data. The congestion of a given node is a functional of the throughputs of all ON connections going through it, and causes losses to these connections. Any ON connection reacts to its losses by self-adapting its throughput in TCP-like fashion so as to control network congestion. The connections interact through this feedback loop. The system constituted of their states (either OFF, or ON with some throughput) evolves in Markovian fashion, and since the number of connections in each class is potentially huge, a mean-field limit result with an adequate scaling is proved so as to reduce dimensionality.

Each arrival process is approximated as an exponential residual (ER) renewal process that is characterized by three parameters: intensity, residue, and decrement. While the ER renewal process is adopted for modeling autocorrelated processes, the innovations method is used for modeling the cross correlation between randomly split streams. As the interarrival times of an ER renewal process follow a two-stage mixed generalized Erlang distribution, viz., MGE(2), each station is analyzed as an MGE(2)/G/1 system for the approximate mean waiting time. Variability functions are also used in network equations for a more accurate modeling of the propagation of cross correlations in queueing networks. Since an ER renewal process is a special case of a Markovian arrival process (MAP), the value of the variability function is determined by a MAP/MAP/1 approximation of the departure process. Numerical results show that our proposed approach greatly improves the performance of the parametric decomposition approximation of open queueing networks.",2011,2011-06,68,2,193-216,"Kim, Sunkyo (Ajou University)",Ajou University,3,1,,138
10.1007/s11134-011-9211-8,Positive recurrence for reflecting Brownian motion in higher dimensions,"Semimartingale reflecting Brownian motions (SRBMs) are diffusion processes with state space the d-dimensional nonnegative orthant, in the interior of which the processes evolve according to a Brownian motion, and that reflect against the boundary in a specified manner. A standard problem is to determine under what conditions the process is positive recurrent. Necessary and sufficient conditions for positive recurrence are easy to formulate in d=2, but not in d‚â•3.Fluid paths are solutions of deterministic equations that correspond to the random equations of the SRBM. A¬†standard result of Dupuis and Williams (in Ann. Probab. 22:680‚Äì702, 1994) states that when every fluid path associated with the SRBM is attracted to the origin, the SRBM is positive recurrent.

A holding cost is charged for keeping the orders in the system and there is a penalty associated with the switches of the server between stations. Our objective is to minimize the long-run average costs by dynamically assigning the server to stations based on the system state. Using sample-path arguments, we provide partial characterizations of the optimal policy and provide sufficient conditions under which a simple state-independent policy that works on one order at a time is optimal.

(in arXiv:0809.1393 (2008)) proposed a model for the pattern of defaults seen among a group of firms at the end of a given time period. The ingredients in the model are a graph G=(V,E), where the vertices V correspond to the firms and the edges E describe the network of interdependencies between the firms, a parameter for each vertex that captures the individual propensity of that firm to default, and a parameter for each edge that captures the joint propensity of the two connected firms to default. The correlated default model can be rewritten as a standard Ising model on the graph by identifying the set of defaulting firms in the default model with the set of sites in the Ising model for which the {¬±1}-valued spin is +1. We ask whether there is a suitable continuous-time Markov chain (Xt)t‚â•0 taking values in the subsets of V such that X0=‚àÖ, Xr‚äÜXs for r‚â§s (that is, once a firm defaults, it stays in default), the distribution of XT for some fixed time T is the one given by the default model, and the distribution of Xt for other times t is described by a probability distribution in the same family as the default model. In terms of the equivalent Ising model, this corresponds to asking if it is possible to begin at time 0 with a configuration in which every spin is ‚àí1 and then flip spins one at a time from ‚àí1 to +1 according to Markovian dynamics so that the configuration of spins at each time is described by some Ising model and at time T the configuration is distributed according to the prescribed Ising model.

In one such model, jobs arrive according to a rate-Œ±N Poisson process, with Œ±<1, in a system of N rate-1 exponential server queues. In Vvedenskaya et al. (Probl. Inf. Transm. 32:15‚Äì29, 1996), it was shown that when each arriving job is assigned to the shortest of D, D‚â•2, randomly chosen queues, the equilibrium queue sizes decay doubly exponentially in the limit as N‚Üí‚àû. This is a substantial improvement over the case D=1, where queue sizes decay exponentially.The reasoning in Vvedenskaya et al. (Probl. Inf. Transm. 32:15‚Äì29, 1996) does not easily generalize to jobs with nonexponential service time distributions. A¬†modularized program for treating randomized load balancing problems with general service time distributions was introduced in Bramson et al. (Proc. ACM SIGMETRICS, pp.¬†275‚Äì286, 2010). The program relies on an ansatz that asserts that, for a randomized load balancing scheme in equilibrium, any fixed number of queues become independent of one another as N‚Üí‚àû. This allows computation of queue size distributions and other performance measures of interest.In this article, we demonstrate the ansatz in several settings. We consider the least loaded balancing problem, where an arriving job is assigned to the queue with the smallest workload. We also consider the more difficult problem, where an arriving job is assigned to the queue with the fewest jobs, and demonstrate the ansatz when the service discipline is FIFO and the service time distribution has a decreasing hazard rate. Last, we show the ansatz always holds for a sufficiently small arrival rate, as long as the service distribution has 2 moments.",2012,2012-07,71,3,247-292,"Bramson, Maury (University of Minnesota); Lu, Yi (University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign); Prabhakar, Balaji (Stanford University)",Stanford University; University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign; University of Minnesota,97,18,,591

In addition, it is well known that setting the drift of the Lyapunov function equal to zero in steady state provides bounds on the expected queue lengths.

The main contribution of this paper is to show that the approach of ‚Äúsetting the drift of a Lyapunov function equal to zero‚Äù can be used to obtain bounds on the steady-state queue lengths which are tight in the heavy-traffic limit. The key is to establish an appropriate notion of state-space collapse in terms of steady-state moments of weighted queue length differences and use this state-space collapse result when setting the Lyapunov drift equal to zero. As an application of the methodology, we prove the steady-state equivalent of the heavy-traffic optimality result of Stolyar for wireless networks operating under the MaxWeight scheduling policy.",2012,2012-12,72,4-Mar,311-359,"Eryilmaz, Atilla (The Ohio State University); Srikant, R.

The customer classes are distinguished by their interarrival time, service time, and abandonment time distributions. There is a cost ck>0 for every class k‚àà{1,2,‚Ä¶,N} customer that abandons the queue before receiving service. The objective is to minimize average cost by dynamically choosing which customer class the server should next serve each time the server becomes available (and there are waiting customers from at least two classes).It is not possible to solve this control problem exactly, and so we formulate an approximating Brownian control problem. The Brownian control problem incorporates the entire abandonment distribution of each customer class.

Each user wishes to obtain service as early as possible, while minimizing the expected wait in the queue. This problem was recently studied within a simplified fluid-scale model. Here, we address the unscaled stochastic system, assuming a finite (possibly random) number of homogeneous users, exponential service times, and linear cost functions. In this setting, we establish that there exists a unique Nash equilibrium, which is symmetric across users, and characterize the equilibrium arrival-time distribution of each user in terms of a corresponding set of differential equations. We further establish convergence of the Nash equilibrium solution to that of the associated fluid model as the number of users is increased. We finally consider the price of anarchy in our system and show that it exceeds 2, but converges to this value for a large population size.",2012,2013-08,74,4,369-402,"Juneja, Sandeep (Tata Institute of Fundamental Research); Shimkin, Nahum (Technion ‚Äì Israel Institute of Technology)",Technion ‚Äì Israel Institute of Technology; Tata Institute of Fundamental Research,28,6,,575
10.1007/s11134-012-9326-6,On scheduling a multiclass queue with abandonments under general delay costs,"We consider a multiclass queueing system with abandonments and general delay costs. A system manager makes dynamic scheduling decisions to minimize long-run average delay and abandonment costs. We consider the three types of delay cost: (i)¬†linear, (ii)¬†convex, and (iii)¬†convex‚Äìconcave, where the last one corresponds to settings where customers may have a particular deadline in mind but once that deadline passes there is increasingly little difference in the added delay. The dynamic control problem for the queueing system is not tractable analytically. Therefore, we consider the system in the conventional heavy traffic regime and study the approximating Brownian control problem (BCP). We observe that the approximating BCP does not admit a pathwise solution due to abandonments. In particular, the celebrated cŒº rule and its extension, the generalized cŒº rule, which is asymptotically optimal under convex delay costs with no abandonments, are not optimal in this case. Consequently, we solve the associated Bellman equation, which yields a dynamic index policy (derived from the value function) as the optimal control for the approximating BCP. Interpreting that control in the context of the original queueing system, we propose practical policies for each of the three cases considered and demonstrate their effectiveness through a simulation study.",2012,2013-05,74,1,65-104,"Ata, Barƒ±≈ü (Northwestern University); Tongarlak, Mustafa H.

The arrival process can have a time-varying arrival rate. In particular, an FWLLN and an FCLT were established for the two-parameter process describing the number of customers in the system at time t that have been so for a duration y. The present paper extends the previous results to cover the case in which the successive service times are weakly dependent. The deterministic fluid limit obtained from the new FWLLN is unaffected by the dependence, whereas the Gaussian process limit (random field) obtained from the FCLT has a term resulting from the dependence. Explicit expressions are derived for the time-dependent means, variances, and covariances for the common case in which the limit process for the arrival process is a (possibly time scaled) Brownian motion.",2012,2013-02,73,2,119-146,"Pang, Guodong (Pennsylvania State University); Whitt, Ward (Columbia University)",Pennsylvania State University; Columbia University,20,2,,412
10.1007/s11134-012-9293-y,Queueing systems with hard delay constraints: a framework for real-time communication over unreliable wireless channels,"We provide an account of recent work that formulates and addresses problems that arise when employing wireless networks to serve clients that generate real-time flows. From a queueing systems perspective, these problems can be described as single-server problems where there are several customer classes. Customers balk when their delay exceeds a threshold. There are a range of issues that are of interest. One of the first such issues is to determine what throughput rate vectors are feasible, and to determine the server‚Äôs schedule. Another is to maximize a utility function of the departure rates of the customer classes.Real-time flows have a delay bound for each of their packets. It is particularly challenging to provide delay guarantees for real-time flows in wireless networks since wireless transmissions are unreliable. We propose a model that jointly considers the delay bounds of packets, the unreliable wireless channels, and the throughput requirements of clients. We then determine the necessary and sufficient condition for feasibility of the client requirements. The analysis and condition are interesting since this problem gives rise to some new features concerning unavoidable idle times in a system. We further derive an efficient, nearly linear time algorithm for admission control, which precisely determines whether it is feasible to fulfill the requirements of all clients in the system. We also propose two on-line scheduling policies and prove that they can fulfill the requirements of all clients whenever that is feasible.We next turn to the scenario where the throughput requirements of clients are elastic, but with hard delay bounds. We formulate this as a utility maximization problem, where client utilities are based on their throughputs. We decompose this problem into two subproblems, and show that this decomposition can be naturally implemented as a bidding game among all clients and the access point, which plays the role of a centralized scheduler. In the bidding game, the strategy of each client is to carry out a simple selfish optimization. We show that the strategy of the access point can be implemented by a simple on-line scheduling policy. A surprising result is that the channel reliabilities need not be known a priori.",2012,2012-06,71,2-Jan,151-177,"Hou, I-Hong (Texas A&M University); Kumar, P. R.

More specifically, we focus on Jackson networks in which the total capacity of the servers can be redistributed over all queues in any desired way. If we associate a cost to waiting that is linear in the queue lengths, it is known from the literature how the operators should share the available service capacity to minimize the long run total cost. This paper deals with the question whether or not (the operators of) the individual queues will indeed cooperate in this way, and if so, how they could share the cost in the new situation such that each operator never pays more than his own cost without cooperation. For the particular case of a tandem network with two or three nodes it is known from previous work that cooperation is indeed beneficial, but for larger tandem networks and for general Jackson networks this question was still open. The main result of this paper gives for any Jackson network an explicit cost allocation that is beneficial for all operators.

Practical wireless network coding solutions depend on knowledge of overhearing events which is obtained either by acknowledgments or statistically. In the latter case, the knowledge about each packet improves progressively with feedback from the transmissions. We propose a virtual network mechanism in order to characterize the throughput region of such a system for the case where we allow only pairwise XORing. We also provide the policy which achieves the stability region and compare it to simple heuristics. The derived policy is a modification of the standard backpressure policy, designed to take into account the fact that in the proposed virtual network the destination of a transmitted packet is known only probabilistically.

Our motivation is to find exact tail asymptotics (beyond logarithmic estimates) for the marginal distributions, which requires an exact solution for the bivariate generating function describing the stationary distribution. This exact solution is determined via the theory of boundary value problems. Although this is a classical approach, the present random walk exhibits some salient features. In fact, to determine the exact tail asymptotics, the random walk presents several unprecedented challenges related to conformal mappings and analytic continuation.

This leads to inconsistency in the views of the network across nodes, which, coupled with interference, makes it challenging to schedule for high throughputs.We characterize the network throughput region for this setup, and develop optimal scheduling policies to achieve the same. Our scheduling policies have a threshold-based structure and, moreover, require the nodes to use only the ‚Äúsmallest critical subset‚Äù of the available delayed NSI to make decisions. In addition, using Markov chain mixing techniques, we quantify the impact of delayed NSI on the throughput region.

10.1007/s11134-012-9289-7,On optimizing CSMA for wide area ad hoc networks,"The recent deployment of data-rich smart phones has led to a fresh impetus for understanding the performance of wide area ad hoc networks. The most popular medium access mechanism for such ad hoc networks is CSMA/CA with RTS/CTS. In CSMA-like mechanisms, spatial reuse is achieved by implementing energy-based guard zones. We consider the problem of simultaneously scheduling the maximum number of links that can achieve a given signal to interference ratio (SIR). In this paper, using tools from stochastic geometry, we study and maximize the medium access probability of a typical link. Our contributions are two-fold: (i) We show that a simple modification to the RTS/CTS mechanism, viz., changing the receiver yield decision from an energy-level guard zone to an SIR guard zone, leads to performance gains; and (ii) We show that this combined with a simple modification to the transmit power level‚Äîsetting it inversely proportional to the square root of the link gain‚Äîleads to significant improvements in network throughput. Further, this simple power-level choice is no worse than a factor of two away from optimal over the class of all ‚Äúlocal‚Äù power level selection strategies for fading channels, and further is optimal in the non-fading case. The analysis relies on an extension of the Mat√©rn hard core point process which allows us to quantify both these SIR guard zones and this power control mechanism.",2012,2012-10,72,2-Jan,31-68,,The University of Texas at Austin; D√©partement d'Informatique,12,0,,449

The standard fluid models in general are not sufficient to establish the stability region of these systems under static priority policies. Therefore, we use a novel and a general approach to augment the fluid model equations based on induced Markov chains. Using this new approach, we establish the stability region of these systems under a static priority rule with thresholds when the service and interarrival times have phase-type distributions. We show that, in certain cases, the stability region depends on the distributions of the service and interarrival times (beyond their mean), on the number of servers in the system, and on the threshold value. We also show that it is possible to expand the stability region in these systems by increasing the variability of the service times (without changing their mean) while keeping the other parameters fixed.

The original formulations considered linear costs, and the resulting policy is puzzling in many ways. The main one is that, either for preemptive or nonpreemptive problems, it results in a priority ordering of the different classes of customers being served that is insensitive to the individual load each class imposes on the server and insensitive to the overall load the server experiences. This policy is known as the cŒº-rule.We claim and show that for convex costs, the optimal policy depends on the individual loads. Therefore, there is a need for an alternative generalization of the cŒº-rule. The main feature of our generalization consists on first-order differences of the single stage cost function, rather than on its derivatives.

10.1007/s11134-012-9315-9,Load balancing via random local search in closed and open systems,"In this paper, we analyze the performance of random load resampling and migration strategies in parallel server systems. Clients initially attach themselves to an arbitrary server, but may switch servers independently at random instants of time in an attempt to improve their service rate. This approach to load balancing contrasts with traditional approaches where clients make smart server selections upon arrival (e.g., Join-the-Shortest-Queue policy and variants thereof). Load resampling is particularly relevant in scenarios where clients cannot predict the load of a server before being actually attached to it. An important example is in wireless spectrum sharing where clients try to share a set of frequency bands in a distributed manner.We first analyze the natural Random Local Search (RLS) strategy. Under this strategy, after sampling a new server randomly, clients only switch to it if their service rate is improved. In closed systems, where the client population is fixed, we derive tight estimates of the time it takes under RLS strategy to balance the load across servers. We then study open systems where clients arrive according to a random process and leave the system upon service completion. In this scenario, we analyze how client migrations within the system interact with the system dynamics induced by client arrivals and departures. We compare the load-aware RLS strategy to a load-oblivious strategy in which clients just randomly switch server without accounting for the server loads. Surprisingly, we show that both load-oblivious and load-aware strategies stabilize the system whenever this is at all possible. We use large-system asymptotics to characterize system performance, and augment this with simulations, which suggest that the average client sojourn time under the load-oblivious strategy is not considerably reduced when clients apply smarter load-aware strategies.",2012,2012-07,71,3,321-345,"Ganesh, Ayalvadi (University of Bristol); Lilienthal, Sarah (University of Cambridge); Manjunath, D.

We prove that CSMA is optimal in the ad-hoc mode, when each flow goes through a unique dedicated wireless link from a transmitter to a receiver. It is generally suboptimal in infrastructure mode, when all data flows originate from or are destined to the same set of access points, due to the inherent bias of CSMA against downlink traffic. We propose a slight modification of CSMA that we refer to as flow-aware CSMA, which corrects this bias and makes the algorithm optimal in all cases.

10.1007/s11134-012-9285-y,Optimal size-based opportunistic scheduler for wireless systems,"Modern wireless cellular systems are able to utilize the opportunistic scheduling gain originating from the variability in the users‚Äô channel conditions. By favoring users with good instantaneous channel conditions, the service capacity of the system can be increased with the number of users. On the other hand, for service systems with fixed service capacity, the system performance can be optimized by utilizing the size information. Combining the advantages of size-based scheduling with opportunistic scheduling gain has proven to be a challenging task. In this paper, we consider scheduling of data traffic (finite-size elastic flows) in wireless cellular systems. Assuming that the channel conditions for different users are independent and identically distributed, we show how to optimally combine opportunistic and size-based scheduling in the transient setting with all flows available at time 0. More specifically, by utilizing the time scale separation assumption, we develop a recursive algorithm that produces the optimal long-run service rate vectors within the corresponding capacity regions. We also prove that the optimal operating policy applies the SRPT-FM principle, i.e., the shortest flow is served with the highest rate of the optimal rate vector, the second shortest with the second highest rate, etc. Moreover, we determine explicitly how to implement the optimal rate vectors in the actual time slot level opportunistic scheduler. In addition to the transient setting, we explore the dynamic case with randomly arriving flows under illustrative channel scenarios by simulations. Interestingly, the scheduling policy that is optimal for the transient setting can be improved in the dynamic case under high traffic load by applying a rate-based priority scheduler that breaks the ties based on the SRPT principle.",2012,2012-10,72,2-Jan,30-May,"Aalto, Samuli (Aalto University); Penttinen, Aleksi (Aalto University); Lassila, Pasi (Aalto University); Osti, Prajwal (Aalto University)",Aalto University,7,0,,174

Special cases of the introduced network include well-known polling models, tandem queues, systems with a waiting room, multi-stage models with parallel queues, and many others.

10.1007/s11134-012-9313-y,Controlled mobility in stochastic and dynamic wireless networks,"We consider the use of controlled mobility in wireless networks where messages arriving randomly in time and space are collected by mobile receivers (collectors). The collectors are responsible for receiving these messages via wireless transmission by dynamically adjusting their position in the network. Our goal is to utilize a combination of wireless transmission and controlled mobility to improve the throughput and delay performance in such networks. First, we consider a system with a single collector. We show that the necessary and sufficient stability condition for such a system is given by œÅ<1 where œÅ is the expected system load. We derive lower bounds for the expected message waiting time in the system and develop policies that are stable for all loads œÅ<1 and have asymptotically optimal delay scaling. We show that the combination of mobility and wireless transmission results in a delay scaling of  delay scaling in the corresponding system without wireless transmission, where the collector visits each message location. Next, we consider the system with multiple collectors. In the case where simultaneous transmissions to different collectors do not interfere with each other, we show that both the stability condition and the delay scaling extend from the single collector case. In the case where simultaneous transmissions to different collectors interfere with each other, we characterize the stability region of the system and show that a frame-based version of the well-known Max-Weight policy stabilizes the system asymptotically in the frame length.",2012,2012-12,72,4-Mar,251-277,"√áelik, G√ºner D.

10.1007/s11134-012-9286-x,Stability and delay of distributed scheduling algorithms for networks of conflicting queues,"This paper explains recent results on distributed algorithms for networks of conflicting queues. At any given time, only specific subsets of queues can be served simultaneously. The challenge is to select the subsets in a distributed way to stabilize the queues whenever the arrival rates are feasible.One key idea is to formulate the subset selection as an optimization problem where the objective function includes the entropy of the distribution of the selected subsets. The dual algorithm for solving this optimization problem provides a distributed scheduling algorithm that requires only local queue-length information. The algorithm is based on the CSMA (Carrier Sense Multiple Access) protocol in wireless networks.We also explain recent results, some of them unpublished so far, on the delay properties of these algorithms. In particular, we present a framework for queuing stability under bounded CSMA parameters, and show how the expected queue lengths depend on the throughput region to be supported. When the arrival rates are within a fraction of the capacity region, queue lengths that are polynomial (or even logarithmic) in the number of queues can be achieved.",2012,2012-10,72,2-Jan,161-187,"Jiang, Libin (California Institute of Technology); Walrand, Jean (University of California, Berkeley)","California Institute of Technology; University of California, Berkeley",6,0,,356

Within this framework a Lyapunov method for stability of GFN models was proposed by Ye and Chen. They proved that stability of a GFN model is equivalent to the existence of a functional on the set of paths that is decaying along paths. This result falls short of a converse Lyapunov theorem in that no state-dependent Lyapunov function is constructed. In this paper we construct state-dependent Lyapunov functions in contrast to path-wise functionals. We first show by counterexamples that closed GFN models do not provide sufficient information that allow for a converse Lyapunov theorem. To resolve this problem we introduce the class of strict GFN models by forcing closed GFN models to satisfy a concatenation and a semicontinuity condition. For the class of strict GFN models we define a state-dependent Lyapunov function and show that a converse Lyapunov theorem holds. Finally, it is shown that common fluid network models, like general work-conserving and priority fluid network models as well as certain linear Skorokhod problems define strict GFN models.",2012,2012-04,70,4,339-367,"Sch√∂nlein, Michael (University of W√ºrzburg); Wirth, Fabian (University of W√ºrzburg)",University of W√ºrzburg,6,1,,123

Balanced fairness results in the insensitivity of the stationary distribution of the number in the system to the precise distribution of file sizes. Balanced fairness has been shown to coincide with proportional fairness in large systems. The model we consider is that of servers operating under balanced fair rate allocations that are accessed by a large number of independent heterogeneous flows characterized by their arrival rate and general distributions of the file sizes; and a maximum service rate associated with each type of flow. The largeness of the system is parameterized by a scaling parameter that scales the arrival rates and capacity in such a way that the ratio is fixed. By exploiting a connection of the congestion probabilities with multirate Erlang loss systems, we use local limit large deviation methods to obtain accurate approximations as the scaling increases.

10.1007/s11134-012-9317-7,A performance analysis of channel fragmentation in dynamic spectrum access systems,"Dynamic Spectrum Access systems offer temporarily available spectrum to opportunistic users capable of spreading transmissions over a number of non-contiguous subchannels. Such methods can be highly beneficial in terms of spectrum utilization, but excessive fragmentation degrades performance and hence off-sets the benefits. To get some insight into acceptable levels of fragmentation, we present experimental and analytical results derived from a mathematical model. According to the model, a system operates at capacity serving requests for bandwidth by assigning a collection of one or more gaps of unused bandwidth to each request as bandwidth becomes available. Our main result is a proof that, even if fragments can be arbitrarily small, the system remains stable in the sense that the average total number of fragments remains bounded. Within the class of dynamic fragmentation models, including models of dynamic storage allocation that have been around for many decades, this result appears to be the first of its kind.In addition, we provide extensive experimental results that describe behavior, at times unexpected, of fragmentation as parameter values are varied. Different scanning rules for searching gaps of available spectrum, all covered by the above stability result, are also studied. Our model applies to dynamic linked-list storage allocation, and provides a novel analysis in that domain. We prove that, interestingly, a version of the 50¬†% rule of the classical, non-fragmented allocation model holds for the new model as well. Overall, the paper provides insights into the behavior of practical fragmentation algorithms.",2012,2012-07,71,3,293-320,"Coffman, Ed (Columbia University); Robert, Philippe (French Institute for Research in Computer Science and Automation); Simatos, Florian (National Research Institute for Mathematics and Computer Science); Tarumi, Shuzo (Columbia University); Zussman, Gil (Columbia University)",National Research Institute for Mathematics and Computer Science; French Institute for Research in Computer Science and Automation; Columbia University,5,1,,1233

10.1007/s11134-012-9297-7,Distributed caching over heterogeneous mobile networks,"Sharing content over a mobile network through opportunistic contacts has recently received considerable attention. In proposed scenarios, users store content they download in a local cache and share it with other users they meet, e.g., via Bluetooth or WiFi. The storage capacity of mobile devices is typically limited; therefore, identifying which content a user should store in her cache is a fundamental problem in the operation of any such content distribution system.In this work we propose Psephos, a novel mechanism for determining the caching policy of each mobile user. Psephos is fully distributed: users compute their own policies individually, in the absence of a central authority. Moreover, it is designed for a heterogeneous environment, in which demand for content, access to resources, and mobility characteristics may vary across different users. Most importantly, the caching policies computed by our mechanism are optimal: we show that Psephos maximizes the system‚Äôs social welfare.

10.1007/s11134-012-9306-x,Log-weight scheduling in switched networks,"We consider switched queueing networks in which there are constraints on which queues may be served simultaneously. The scheduling policy for such a network specifies which queues to serve at any point in time. We introduce and study a variant of the popular maximum weight or backpressure policy which chooses the collection of queues to serve that has maximum weight. Unlike the maximum weight policies studied in the literature, the weight of a queue depends on logarithm of its queue-size in this paper. For any multihop switched network operating under such maximum log-weighted policy, we establish that the network Markov process is positive recurrent as long as it is underloaded. As the main result of this paper, a meaningful fluid model is established as the formal functional law of large numbers approximation. The fluid model is shown to be work-conserving. That is, work (or total queue-size) is nonincreasing as long as the network is underloaded or critically loaded. We identify invariant states or fixed points of the fluid model. When underloaded, null state is the unique invariant state. For a critically loaded fluid model, the space of invariant states is characterized as the solution space of an optimization problem whose objective is lexicographic ordering of total queue-size and the negative entropy of the queue state. An important contribution of this work is in overcoming the challenge presented by the log-weight function in establishing meaningful fluid model. Specifically, the known approaches in the literature primarily relied on the ‚Äúscale invariance‚Äù property of the weight function that log-function does not possess.",2012,2012-06,71,2-Jan,97-136,"Shah, Devavrat (Massachusetts Institute of Technology); Wischik, Damon (University College London)",University College London; Massachusetts Institute of Technology,4,1,,207

For such functions we characterize the maximum achievable refresh rate of the network in terms of an underlying graph primitive, the min-mincut. In acyclic wireline networks we show that the maximum refresh rate is achievable by a simple algorithm that is dynamic, distributed, and only dependent on local information.

Outside of the class of product form networks (e.g., Jackson, Kelly, and BCMP networks), one must resort to bounds, simulation, asymptotic studies or approximations. By focusing on a class of two-station closed reentrant queueing networks under the last buffer first served (LBFS) policy, we show that non-product form equilibrium probabilities can be obtained. When the number of customer classes in the network is five or fewer, explicit solutions can be obtained. Otherwise, we require the roots of a characteristic polynomial and a matrix inversion that depend only on the network topology. The approach relies on two key points. First, under LBFS, the state space can be reduced to four dimensions independent of the number of buffers in the system. Second, there is a sense of spatial causality in the global balance equations that can then be exploited.To our knowledge, these two-station closed reentrant queueing networks under LBFS represent the first class of queueing networks for which explicit non-product form equilibrium probabilities can be constructed (for five customer classes or less), the generic form of the equilibrium probabilities can be deduced and matrix analytic approaches can be applied.

10.1007/s11134-012-9282-1,Additive functionals with application to sojourn times in infinite-server and processor sharing systems,"We deal with additive functionals of stationary processes. It is shown that under some assumptions a stationary model of the time-changed process exists. Further, bounds for the expectation of functions of additive functionals are derived. As an application we analyze virtual sojourn times in an infinite-server system where the service speed is governed by a stationary process. It turns out that the sojourn time of some kind of virtual requests equals in distribution an additive functional of a stationary time-changed process, which provides bounds for the expectation of functions of virtual sojourn times, in particular bounds for fractional moments and the distribution function. Interpreting the GI(n)/GI(n)/‚àû system or equivalently the GI(n)/GI system under state-dependent processor sharing as an infinite-server system where the service speed is governed by the number n of requests in the system provides results for sojourn times of virtual requests. In the case of M(n)/GI(n)/‚àû, the sojourn times of arriving and added requests equal in distribution sojourn times of virtual requests in modified systems, which yields several results for the sojourn times of arriving and added requests. In case of positive integer moments, the bounds generalize earlier results for M/GI(n)/‚àû. In particular, the mean sojourn times of arriving and added requests in M(n)/GI(n)/‚àû are proportional to the required service time, generalizing Cohen‚Äôs famous result for M/GI(n)/‚àû.",2012,2012-04,70,4,369-409,"Brandt, Manfred (Zuse Institute Berlin); Brandt, Andreas (Humboldt-Universit√§t zu Berlin)",Humboldt-Universit√§t zu Berlin; Zuse Institute Berlin,0,0,,100

The manager of such a queue has the task of implementing a queueing discipline that results in the performance targets for all classes being met simultaneously. For the case where the performance targets are specified in terms of ratios of mean waiting times, as long ago as the 1960s, Kleinrock suggested a queueing discipline to ensure that the targets are achieved. He proposed that customers accumulate priority as a linear function of their time in the queue: the higher the urgency of the customer‚Äôs class, the greater the rate at which that customer accumulates priority. When the server becomes free, the customer (if any) with the highest accumulated priority at that time point is the one that is selected for service. Kleinrock called such a queue a time-dependent priority queue, but we shall refer to it as the accumulating priority queue.

10.1007/s11134-013-9354-x,Data-stories about (im)patient customers in tele-queues,"Credible queueing models of human services acknowledge human characteristics. A prevalent one is the ability of humans to abandon their wait, for example while waiting to be answered by a telephone agent, waiting for a physician‚Äôs checkup at an emergency department, or waiting for the completion of an internet transaction. Abandonments can be very costly, to either the service provider (a forgone profit) or the customer (deteriorating health after leaving without being seen by a doctor), and often to both. Practically, models that ignore abandonment can lead to either over- or under-staffing; and in well-balanced systems (e.g., well-managed telephone call centers), the ‚Äúfittest (needy) who survive‚Äù and reach service are rewarded with surprisingly short delays. Theoretically, the phenomenon of abandonment is interesting and challenging, in the context of Queueing Theory and Science as well as beyond (e.g., Psychology). Last, but not least, queueing models with abandonment are more robust and numerically stable, when compared against their abandonment-ignorant analogues. For our relatively narrow purpose here, abandonment of customers, while queueing for service, is the operational manifestation of customer patience, perhaps impatience, or (im)patience for short. This (im)patience is the focus of the present paper. It is characterized via the distribution of the time that a customer is willing to wait, and its dynamics are characterized by the hazard-rate of that distribution. We start with a framework for comprehending impatience, distinguishing the times that a customer expects to wait, is required to wait (offered wait), is willing to wait (patience time), actually waits and felt waiting. We describe statistical methods that are used to infer the (im)patience time and offered wait distributions. Then some useful queueing models, as well as their asymptotic approximations, are discussed. In the main part of the paper, we discuss several ‚Äúdata-based pictures‚Äù of impatience. Each ‚Äúpicture‚Äù is associated with an important phenomenon. Some theoretical and practical problems that arise from these phenomena, and existing models and methodologies that address these problems, are outlined. The problems discussed cover statistical estimation of impatience, behavior of overloaded systems, dependence between patience and service time, and validation of queueing models. We also illustrate how impatience changes across customers (e.g., VIP vs. regular customers), during waiting (e.g., in response to announcements) and through phases of service (e.g., after experiencing the answering machine over the phone). Our empirical analysis draws data from repositories at the Technion SEELab, and it utilizes SEEStat‚Äîits online Exploratory Data Analysis environment.

10.1007/s11134-012-9340-8,Gaussian skewness approximation for dynamic rate multi-server queues with abandonment,"The multi-server queue with non-homogeneous Poisson arrivals and customer abandonment is a fundamental dynamic rate queueing model for large scale service systems such as call centers and hospitals. Scaling the arrival rates and number of servers arises naturally when a manager updates a staffing schedule in response to a forecast of increased customer demand. Mathematically, this type of scaling ultimately gives us the fluid and diffusion limits as found in Mandelbaum et al., Queueing Syst 30:149‚Äì201 (1998) for Markovian service networks. The asymptotics used here reduce to the Halfin and Whitt, Oper Res 29:567‚Äì588 (1981) scaling for multi-server queues. The diffusion limit suggests a Gaussian approximation to the stochastic behavior of this queueing process. The mean and variance are easily computed from a two-dimensional dynamical system for the fluid and diffusion limiting processes. Recent work by Ko and Gautam, INFORMS J Comput, to appear (2012) found that a modified version of these differential equations yield better Gaussian estimates of the original queueing system distribution. In this paper, we introduce a new three-dimensional dynamical system that is based on estimating the mean, variance, and third cumulant moment. This improves on the previous approaches by fitting the distribution from a quadratic function of a Gaussian random variable.",2013,2013-11,75,4-Feb,243-277,"Massey, William A.

First, we revisit the variational problem (VP) associated with the SRBM. Building on Avram et al.

Our results provide a geometric interpretation for the value function of the VP and allow one to see geometrically when one edge of the quadrant has influence on the optimal path traveling from the origin to a destination point. Second, we provide a geometric condition that characterizes the existence of a product form stationary distribution.

We show that the optimal policy depends on whether or not one server is dominant (i.e., faster at both stations) and on the magnitude of the efficiency loss of collaborating servers. In particular, if one server is dominant then he must divide his time between the two stations, and we identify the threshold policy the dominant server should use; otherwise each server should focus on the station where he is the faster server.

The extended model can be viewed as a layered queueing network, where the first layer consists of the queues of products and the second layer is the ordinary machine-repair model. As the repair time of one machine may affect the time the other machine is not able to process products, the downtimes of the machines are correlated. This correlation leads to dependence between the queues of products in the first layer. Analysis of these queue length distributions is hard, as the exact dependence structure for the downtimes, or the queue lengths, is not known. Therefore, we obtain an approximation for the complete marginal queue length distribution of any queue in the first layer, by viewing such a queue as a single server queue with correlated server downtimes. Under an explicit assumption on the form of the downtime dependence, we obtain exact results for the queue length distribution for that single server queue. We use these exact results to approximate the machine-repair model. We do so by computing the downtime correlation for the latter model and by subsequently using this information to fine-tune the parameters we introduced to the single server queue. As a result, we immediately obtain an approximation for the queue length distributions of products in the machine-repair model, which we show to be highly accurate by extensive numerical experiments.",2013,2013-09,75,1,29-63,"Dorsman, J.

We first present exact queue-length and delay results for some specific cases and we derive stochastic bounds for a much richer set of scenarios. Using these, together with stochastic relations between systems with different vacation disciplines, we examine the scaled queue length and delay in a heavy-traffic regime, and demonstrate a sharp trichotomy, depending on how the activation rate and vacation probability behave as function of the queue length. In particular, the effect of the vacation periods may either (i) completely vanish in heavy-traffic conditions, (ii) contribute an additional term to the queue lengths and delays of similar magnitude, or even (iii) give rise to an order-of-magnitude increase.

In the context of exact sampling, the monotonicity structure of JQNs ensures that such efficiency is of the order of the coupling time (or meeting time) of two extremal sample paths. In the context of approximate sampling, it is given by the mixing time. Under a condition on the drift of the stochastic process underlying a JQN, which we call hyper-stability, in our main result we show that the coupling time is polynomial in both the number of queues and buffer sizes. Then, we use this result to show that the mixing time of JQNs behaves similarly up to a given precision threshold. Our proof relies on a recursive formula relating the coupling times of trajectories that start from network states having ‚Äúdistance one‚Äù, and it can be used to analyze the coupling and mixing times of other Markovian networks, provided that they are monotone.

10.1007/s11134-014-9398-6,A Computational approach to optimized appointment scheduling,"Appointment scheduling is prevalent in various healthcare settings. Generally, the objective is to determine a schedule (i.e., the sequence of epochs at which the individual patients are asked to appear) that appropriately balances the interests of the patients (low waiting times) and the medical staff (low idle times). In queueing language, the planner is given the distributions of the service times of the individual clients, and then it is his task to determine the arrival epochs of the clients. In this paper, we demonstrate how to generate schedules that have certain optimality properties. As a general principle, we express the performance of a schedule in terms of its associated utility, which incorporates both waiting times and idle times. In a first class of schedules (referred to as the simultaneous approach), the arrival epochs are chosen such that the sum of the utilities of all clients as well as the service provider is minimized. In a second class (sequential approach), the arrival epoch of the next client is scheduled, given the scheduled arrival epochs of all previous clients. For general service times the numerical evaluation of the optimal schedules is often prohibitive; it essentially requires knowledge of the waiting-time distribution in an appropriately chosen D/G/1 queue. In this paper, we demonstrate that by using the phase-type counterparts of the service-time distributions, it is feasible to efficiently determine an optimized schedule, that is, we obtain accurate results with low computational effort. We do so both for transient scenarios (in which the number of clients is relatively low, so that the interarrival time is not uniform) and stationary scenarios (with many clients, and essentially constant interarrival times). Our approach is backed by several examples, that give insight in the impact of the variability of the service times on the schedule; it also shows the impact of the utility function selected.",2014,2015-01,79,1,May-36,"Kuiper, Alex (University of Amsterdam); Kemper, Benjamin (University of Amsterdam); Mandjes, Michel (University of Amsterdam)",University of Amsterdam,32,12,,821
10.1007/s11134-014-9409-7,Exact analysis of the M/M/k/setup class of Markov chains via recursive renewal reward,"The M/M/k/setup model, where there is a penalty for turning servers on, is common in data centers, call centers, and manufacturing systems. Setup costs take the form of a time delay, and sometimes there is additionally a power penalty, as in the case of data centers. While the M/M/1/setup was exactly analyzed in 1964, no exact analysis exists to date for the M/M/k/setup with k>1. In this paper, we provide the first exact, closed-form analysis for the M/M/k/setup and some of its important variants including systems in which idle servers delay for a period of time before turning off or can be put to sleep. Our analysis is made possible by a new way of combining renewal reward theory and recursive techniques to solve Markov chains with a repeating structure. Our renewal-based approach uses ideas from renewal reward theory and busy period analysis to obtain closed-form expressions for metrics of interest such as the transform of time in system and the transform of power consumed by the system. The simplicity, intuitiveness, and versatility of our renewal-based approach makes it useful for analyzing Markov chains far beyond the M/M/k/setup. In general, our renewal-based approach should be used to reduce the analysis of any 2-dimensional Markov chain which is infinite in at most one dimension and repeating to the problem of solving a system of polynomial equations. In the case where all transitions in the repeating portion of the Markov chain are skip-free and all up/down arrows are unidirectional, the resulting system of equations will yield a closed-form solution.",2014,2014-06,77,2,177-209,"Gandhi, Anshul (Carnegie Mellon University); Doroudi, Sherwin (Carnegie Mellon University); Harchol-Balter, Mor (Carnegie Mellon University); Scheller-Wolf, Alan (Carnegie Mellon University)",Carnegie Mellon University,24,6,,649

We discuss several applications, for example, from inventory theory and reliability theory, and show that our result extends and generalizes several theorems found in the literature, for example, of queueing-inventory processes.

The process is repeated until consensus is reached. We generalise this so that each member polls a (deterministic or random) number of other group members and changes opinion only if a suitably defined super-majority has a different opinion.

Each new arriving customer is placed for service immediately, either into a server already serving other customers (as long as packing constraints are not violated) or into an idle server. After a service completion, each customer leaves its server and the system. We propose an extremely simple and easily implementable customer placement algorithm, called Greedy-Random (GRAND). It places each arriving customer uniformly at random into either one of the already occupied servers (subject to packing constraints) or one of the so-called zero-servers, which are empty servers designated to be available to new arrivals.

In all cases, the arrival rates are environment dependent, whereas the service rates are environment dependent when the environment Markov process is changing fast, and are assumed to be constant in the other two cases.

In this model, most patients arrive as ‚Äúregular‚Äù customers to the queue, but as the health of a patient degrades, their status is promoted to ‚Äúpriority‚Äù to reflect the increased urgency of the transplant. We model the queueing system as a level-dependent quasi-birth-and-death process, and the steady-state joint queue length distribution as well as the marginal delay distributions for each queue are computed via the use of matrix analytic techniques. The model is calibrated using liver transplantation wait-list data, provided by a regional health centre in Canada, which tracked approximately 1,100 patients over nearly 13 years.

We also study the heavy-traffic behaviour of properly scaled versions of these distributions, which results in compact and closed-form expressions for the distribution functions themselves.

The birth (death) rates in each state are estimated by the observed number of arrivals (departures) in that state divided by the total time spent in that state. Under minor regularity conditions, if the queue length (number in the system) has a proper limiting steady-state distribution, then the fitted BD process has that same steady-state distribution asymptotically as the sample size increases, even if the actual queue-length process is not nearly a BD process. However, the transient behavior may be very different. We investigate what we can learn about the actual queueing system from the fitted BD process. Here we consider the standard GI/GI/s server models, we find that the long-term transient behavior of the original process, as partially characterized by mean first passage times, can be approximated by a deterministic time transformation of the fitted BD process, exploiting the heavy-traffic characterization of the variability.",2014,2015-04,79,4-Mar,391-426,"Dong, James (Cornell University); Whitt, Ward (Columbia University)",Cornell University; Columbia University,9,4,,365

In the vast majority of papers that have appeared on polling models, it is assumed that at each of the individual queues, the customers are served on a first-come-first-served (FCFS) basis. In this paper, we study polling models where the local scheduling policy is not FCFS but instead is varied as last-come-first-served (LCFS), random order of service (ROS), processor sharing (PS), and shortest-job-first (SJF). The service policies are assumed to be either gated or globally gated. The main result of the paper is the derivation of asymptotic closed-form expressions for the Laplace‚ÄìStieltjes transform of the scaled waiting-time and sojourn-time distributions under heavy-traffic assumptions. For FCFS service, the asymptotic sojourn-time distribution is known to be of the form has a generalized trapezoidal distribution. These results are rather intriguing and lead to new fundamental insight into the impact of the local scheduling policy on the performance of polling models. As a by-product, the heavy-traffic results suggest simple closed-form approximations for the complete waiting-time and sojourn-time distributions for stable systems with arbitrary load values.

10.1007/s11134-013-9385-3,On ergodicity conditions in a polling model with Markov modulated input and state-dependent routing,"A polling system with switchover times and state-dependent server routing is studied. Input flows are modulated by a random external environment. Input flows are ordinary Poisson flows in each state of the environment, with intensities determined by the environment state. Service and switchover durations have exponential laws of probability distribution. A continuous-time Markov chain is introduced to describe the dynamics of the server, the sizes of the queues and the states of the environment. By means of the iterative-dominating method a sufficient condition for ergodicity of the system is obtained for the continuous-time Markov chain. This condition also ensures the existence of a stationary probability distribution of the embedded Markov chain at instants of jumps. The customers sojourn cost during the period of unloading the stable queueing system is chosen as a performance metric. Numerical study in case of two input flows and a class of priority and threshold routing algorithms is conducted. It is demonstrated that in case of light inputs a priority routing rule doesn‚Äôt seem to be quasi-optimal.",2014,2014-02,76,2,223-241,"Zorine, Andrei V. (N. I.

Customers join the appointment queue when they call for appointments, stay there (not physically) until the appointment time comes, and then leave the appointment queue and may physically join the service queue, and wait there until served, or become a no-show. The probability of becoming a no-show depends on the time spent in the appointment queue. We build a Tandem Queue model that explicitly captures the dependence between these two queues. We then derive several performance measures of interest, such as service utilization and customer long-run average waiting times in both queues. We also develop several approximation methods to compute the long-run average waiting time in the service queue, including one which is particularly useful when service times in that queue are not exponential.",2014,2015-01,79,1,53-85,"Luo, Jianzhe (University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill); Kulkarni, Vidyadhar G.

10.1007/s11134-014-9415-9,Fluid limits of many-server retrial queues with nonpersistent customers,"This work considers a many-server retrial queueing system in which nonpersistent (impatient) customers with i.i.d., generally distributed service times and independent sequences of i.i.d., generally distributed inter-attempt times. A newly arrived customer attempts to obtain service immediately upon arrival and joins a retrial orbit with probability if all servers are busy, and re-attempts to obtain service after a random amount of time until it gets service. The dynamics of the system is represented in terms of a family of measure-valued processes that keep track of the amounts of time that each customer being served has been in service and the waiting times of customers in the retrial orbit since their previous attempts to obtain service. Under some mild assumptions, as both the arrival rate and the number of servers go to infinity, a law of large numbers (or fluid) limit is established for this family of processes with the aid of the one-dimensional Skorokhod map and a contraction map. The limit is shown to be the unique solution to the so-called (extended) fluid model equations. In addition, the set of invariant states for the (extended) fluid model equations is established and is used to yield some steady state performance measures, such as the steady state blocking probability and the steady state number of customers in the retrial orbit.",2014,2015-02,79,2,183-219,"Kang, Weining ()",,8,2,,280

We reward efficiency by assuming that a revenue is earned each time a job is completed, and penalize poor service quality by incorporating positive holding costs. We study the dynamic assignment of servers to tasks with the objective of maximizing the long-run average profit. For systems of arbitrary size, structured service rates, and linear or nonlinear holding costs, we determine the server assignment policy that maximizes the profit. For systems with two stations, two servers with arbitrary service rates, and linear holding costs, we show that the optimal server assignment policy is of threshold type and determine the value of this threshold as a function of the revenue and holding cost. The threshold can be interpreted as the best possible buffer size, and hence our results prove the equivalence of addressing service quality via a holding cost and via limiting the buffer size. Furthermore, we identify the optimal buffer size when each buffer space comes at a cost. We provide numerical results that suggest that the optimal policy also has a threshold structure for nonlinear holding costs. Finally, for larger systems with arbitrary service rates, we propose effective server assignment heuristics.",2014,2014-08,77,4,427-464,"Kƒ±rkƒ±zlar, Eser (Natera (United States)); Andrad√≥ttir, Sigr√∫n (Georgia Institute of Technology); Ayhan, Hayriye (Georgia Institute of Technology)",Georgia Institute of Technology; Natera (United States),7,4,,370

While relatively simple and inherently distributed in nature, suitably designed queue-based random-access schemes provide the striking capability to match the optimal throughput performance of centralized scheduling mechanisms in a wide range of scenarios. The specific type of activation rules for which throughput optimality has been established, may however yield excessive queues and delays. Motivated by that issue, we examine whether the poor delay performance is inherent to the basic operation of these schemes, or caused by the specific kind of activation rules. We derive delay lower bounds for queue-based activation rules, which offer fundamental insight in the cause of the excessive delays. For fixed activation rates, we obtain lower bounds indicating that delays can grow dramatically with the load in certain topologies as well.",2014,2014-06,77,2,211-242,"Bouman, Niek (Eindhoven University of Technology); Borst, Sem C.

An infinite horizon discounted cost functional which consists of a convex control cost, linear delay and idle server costs, and a linear abandonment cost is formulated. We study this problem in the heavy traffic regime originally proposed by Halfin and Whitt, where the arrival rates and the number of servers grow to infinity in concert. First we address the diffusion control problem (DCP) associated with the heavy traffic limit. By constructing a smooth solution to the associated Hamilton‚ÄìJacobi‚ÄìBellman equation, we obtain a feedback type optimal control for the DCP.

Arriving customers are assigned to the servers by a ‚Äúrouter,‚Äù according to a pull-based algorithm, called PULL. Under the algorithm, each server sends a ‚Äúpull-message‚Äù to the router, when it becomes idle; the router assigns an arriving customer to a server according to a randomly chosen available pull-message, if there are any, or to a random server, otherwise.

We study the rate-matching control, where the service rate is made proportional to the arrival rate. We show that the model with the rate-matching control can be regarded as a deterministic time transformation of a stationary G¬†/¬†G¬†/¬†1 model, so that the queue length distribution is stabilized as time evolves. However, the time-varying virtual waiting time is not stabilized. We show that the time-varying expected virtual waiting time with the rate-matching service-rate control becomes inversely proportional to the arrival rate in a heavy-traffic limit. We also show that no control that stabilizes the queue length asymptotically in heavy traffic can also stabilize the virtual waiting time. Then we consider two square-root service-rate controls and show that one of these stabilizes the waiting time when the arrival rate changes slowly relative to the average service time, so that a pointwise stationary approximation is appropriate.",2015,2015-12,81,4,341-378,"Whitt, Ward (Columbia University)",Columbia University,16,3,,464

A customer who arrives at a full system is blocked and does not receive service. Customers can choose their arrival times with the goal of minimizing their probability of being blocked. We characterise the unique symmetric Nash equilibrium arrival distribution and present a method for computing it. This distribution is comprised of an atom at time zero, an interval with no arrivals (a gap), and a continuous distribution until the closing time. We further present a fluid approximation for the equilibrium behaviour when the population is large, where the fluid solution also admits an atom at zero, no gap, and a uniform distribution throughout the arrival interval. In doing so, we provide an approximation model for the equilibrium behaviour that does not require a numerical solution for a set of differential equations, as is required in the discrete case. For the corresponding problem of social optimization, we provide explicit analysis of some special cases and numerical analysis of the general model.

In general, the optimal policy has a complex dependency on all the input parameters and state information. Our main contribution is to derive index policies that can serve as heuristics and are shown to give good performance. Our index policy attributes to each class an index, which depends on the number of customers currently present in that class. The index values are obtained by solving a relaxed version of the optimal stochastic control problem and combining results from restless multi-armed bandits and queueing theory. They can be expressed as a function of the steady-state distribution probabilities of a one-dimensional birth-and-death process. For linear holding cost, the index can be calculated in closed-form and turns out to be independent of the arrival rates and the number of customers present. In the case of no abandonments and linear holding cost, our index coincides with the.

More concretely, we consider the Geo/Geo/1/L model with probabilities of arrival and departure that are no longer fixed, but are allowed to vary within given intervals. We distinguish between two concepts of independence in this framework, namely repetition independence and epistemic irrelevance. In the first approach, we assume the existence of time-homogeneous probabilities for arrival and departure, which leads us to consider a collection of stationary queues. In the second, the stationarity assumption is dropped and we allow the arrival and departure probabilities to vary from time point to time point; they may even depend on the complete history of queue lengths. We calculate bounds on the expected queue length, the probability of a particular queue length and the probability of turning on the server. For the expected queue length, both approaches coincide. For the other performance measures, we observe and discuss various differences between the bounds obtained for these two approaches. One of our observations is that ergodicity may break down due to imprecision: bounds on expected time averages of certain functions on the state space are not necessarily equal to the bounds on the expectation of that function at random instants in a steady-state queue.",2015,2016-02,82,2-Jan,75-101,"Lopatatzidis, Stavros (Ghent University); De Bock, Jasper (Ghent University); de Cooman, Gert (Ghent University); De Vuyst, Stijn (Ghent University); Walraevens, Joris (Ghent University)",Ghent University,9,4,,362

In this paper, we analyze the popular Trickle algorithm, which has been proposed as a suitable communication protocol for code maintenance and propagation in wireless sensor networks. We show that the broadcasting process of a network using Trickle can be modeled by a Markov chain and that this chain falls under a class of Markov chains, closely related to residual lifetime distributions. It is then shown that this class of Markov chains admits a stationary distribution of a special form. These results are used to analyze the Trickle algorithm and its message count.

10.1007/s11134-015-9464-8,A service system with on-demand agent invitations,"We consider a service system where agents are invited on-demand. Customers arrive exogenously as a Poisson process and join a customer queue upon arrival if no agent is available. Agents decide to accept or decline invitations after some exponentially distributed random time, and join an agent queue upon invitation acceptance if no customer is waiting. A customer and an agent are matched in the order of customer arrival and agent invitation acceptance under the non-idling condition, and will leave the system simultaneously once matched (service times are irrelevant here). We consider a feedback-based adaptive agent invitation scheme, which controls the number of pending agent invitations, depending on the customer and/or agent queue lengths and their changes. The system process has two components‚Äî ‚Äòthe difference between agent and customer queues‚Äô and ‚Äòthe number of pending invitations,‚Äô and is a countable continuous-time Markov chain. For the case when the customer arrival rate is constant, we establish fluid and diffusion limits, in the asymptotic regime where the customer arrival rate goes to infinity, while the agent response rate is fixed. We prove the process stability and fluid-scale limit interchange, which in particular imply that both customer and agent waiting times in steady-state vanish in the asymptotic limit. To do this we develop a novel (multi-scale) Lyapunov drift argument; it is required because the process has non-trivial behavior on the state space boundary. When the customer arrival rate is time-varying, we present a fluid limit for the processes in the same asymptotic regime. Simulation experiments are conducted to show good performance of the invitation scheme and accuracy of fluid limit approximations.",2015,2016-04,82,4-Mar,259-283,"Pang, Guodong (Pennsylvania State University); Stolyar, Alexander L.

10.1007/s11134-015-9454-x,A superharmonic vector for a nonnegative matrix with QBD block structure and its application to a Markov-modulated two-dimensional reflecting process,"Markov modulation is versatile in generalization for making a simple stochastic model, which is often analytically tractable, more flexible in application. In this spirit, we modulate a two-dimensional reflecting skip-free random walk in such a way that its state transitions in the boundary faces and interior of a nonnegative integer quadrant are controlled by Markov chains. This Markov-modulated model is referred to as a 2d-QBD process according to Ozawa (Queueing Syst 74:109‚Äì149, 2013). We are interested in the tail asymptotics of its stationary distribution, which have been well studied when there is no Markov modulation. Ozawa studied this tail asymptotics problem, but his answer is not analytically tractable. We think this is because Markov modulation is so free to change a model even if the state space for Markov modulation is finite. Thus, some structure, say, extra conditions, would be needed to make the Markov modulation analytically tractable while minimizing its limitation in application. The aim of this paper is to investigate such structure for the tail asymptotic problem. For this, we study the existence of a right-subinvariant positive vector, called a superharmonic vector, of a nonnegative matrix with QBD block structure, where each block matrix is finite dimensional. We characterize this existence under a certain extra assumption. We apply this characterization to the 2d-QBD process and derive the tail decay rates of its marginal stationary distribution in an arbitrary direction.

This new model is useful for analyzing the traffic in web portals that match people who provide a service with people who demand the service, for example, employment portals, matrimonial and dating sites, and rental portals. We provide a Markov chain model for these systems and derive the probability distribution of the number of matches up to some finite time given the number of arrivals. We prove that if no control mechanism is employed these systems are unstable for any set of parameters, and suggest four different classes of control policies to assure stability. Contrary to the intuition that the rejection rate should decrease as the users get more likely to match, we show that for certain control policies the rejection rate is insensitive to the matching probability. Even more surprisingly, we show that for reasonable policies the rejection rate may be an increasing function of the matching probability. We also prove insensitivity results related to the average queue lengths and waiting times.",2015,2015-06,80,2-Jan,35-69,"B√ºke, Burak (University of Edinburgh); Chen, Hanyi (University of Edinburgh)",University of Edinburgh,7,4,,328
10.1007/s11134-015-9468-4,Maximum weight matching with hysteresis in overloaded queues with setups,"We consider a system of parallel queues where arriving service tasks are buffered, according to type. Available service resources are dynamically configured and allocated to the queues to process the tasks. At each point in time, a scheduler chooses a service configuration across the queues, in response to queue backlogs. Switching from one service configuration to another incurs a setup time, during which idling occurs and service bandwidth is lost. Such setup times are inherent in manufacturing and computer systems. Frequent switchings can significantly compromise the service capacity of such systems. A maximum weight matching (MWM) scheduler, which is known to maximize throughput in the absence of setups, can easily become unstable with setups, even under low load. To remedy this problem, we propose a new MWM-H scheduler which utilizes a controller introduced hysteresis and achieves maximum throughput even with setups, without requiring knowledge of arrival rates and average traffic loads. During prolonged traffic bursts, the queues may become overloaded and the issue becomes how to reasonably distribute the growing backlog under MWM-H. It is shown that by appropriately selecting the MWM-H parameters, one can control the backlog among the individual queues in order to achieve a desired balance.",2015,2016-04,82,4-Mar,315-351,"Chan, Carri W.

In this paper we consider a single-server queueing system with two infinite queues in which the system time of a tagged customer may depend on both the customers arriving in the system earlier and later than the tagged one. New regular customers arrive in the system according to Markov arrival process (MAP) flow, occupy one place in the buffer and receive service in FIFO order. External re-sequencing signals also arrive at the system according to (different) MAP flow. Each re-sequencing signal transforms one regular customer into a delayed one by moving it to another queue (re-sequencing buffer), wherefrom it is served with lower priority than the regular ones. Service times of customers from both queues also have MAP distribution different from those which govern arrivals.

The flows have exogenous packet arrivals and time-varying service rates. At each time, the server can observe instantaneous service rates for only a subset of flows (selected from a fixed collection of observable subsets) before scheduling a flow in the subset for service. We are interested in queue length aware scheduling to keep the queues short. The limited availability of instantaneous service rate information requires the scheduler to make a careful choice of which subset of service rates to sample. We develop scheduling algorithms that use only partial service rate information from subsets of channels, and that minimize the likelihood of queue overflow in the system. Specifically, we present a new joint subset-sampling and scheduling algorithm called Max-Exp that uses only the current queue lengths to pick a subset of flows, and subsequently schedules a flow using the Exponential rule. When the collection of observable subsets is disjoint, we show that Max-Exp achieves the best exponential decay rate, among all scheduling algorithms that base their decision on the current (or any finite past history of) system state, of the tail of the longest queue. To accomplish this, we employ novel analytical techniques for studying the performance of scheduling algorithms using partial state, which may be of independent interest. These include new sample-path large deviations results for processes obtained by non-random, predictable sampling of sequences of independent and identically distributed random variables. A consequence of these results is that scheduling with partial state information yields a rate function significantly different from scheduling with full channel information. In the special case when the observable subsets are singleton flows, i.e., when there is effectively no a priori channel state information, Max-Exp reduces to simply serving the flow with the longest queue; thus, our results show that to always serve the longest queue in the absence of any channel state information is large deviations optimal.",2015,2015-08,80,4,293-340,"Gopalan, Aditya (Indian Institute of Science Bangalore); Caramanis, Constantine (The University of Texas at Austin); Shakkottai, Sanjay (The University of Texas at Austin)",The University of Texas at Austin; Indian Institute of Science Bangalore,5,1,,184

We consider an witch policy; these policies provide a generalization of the MaxWeight policies of Tassiulas and Ephremides (IEEE Trans Autom Control 37(12):4936‚Äì1948, 1992) and the weighted fair with allocations of Mo and Walrand (IEEE/ACM Trans Netw 8(5):556‚Äì567, 2000) which are typically applied to Bandwidth Sharing Networks (Massouli√© and Roberts in IEEE/ACM Trans Netw 10(3):320‚Äì328, 2002). For single-hop switch networks, we prove the maximum stability property for this class of randomized policies. Thus these policies have the same first-order behavior as the MaxWeight policies. However, for multihop networks some of these generalized polices address a number of critical weakness of the MaxWeight/BackPressure policies. For multihop networks with fixed routing, we consider a policy called the Proportional Scheduler (or (1, log)-policy). In this setting, the BackPressure policy is maximum stable, but must maintain a queue at each node for every route destination, which typically grows rapidly with a network‚Äôs size. However, the Proportional Scheduler only needs to maintain a queue for each outgoing link, which is typically bounded in number. As is common with Internet routing, by maintaining per-link queueing, each node only needs to know the next hop for each packet and not its entire route. Further, in contrast to BackPressure, the Proportional Scheduler does not compare downstream queue lengths to determine weights; only local link information is required. This leads to greater potential for decomposed implementations of the policy. Through a reduction argument and an entropy argument, we demonstrate that, while maintaining substantially less queueing overhead, the Proportional Scheduler achieves maximum throughput stability.",2015,2015-11,81,3-Feb,265-299,"Walton, Neil (University of Amsterdam)",University of Amsterdam,4,2,,1410

Due to the general character of our scaling scheme of abandonment time, the stochastic equation for the limit of C-tight, scaled, and centered customer-count processes contains a nonlinear drift term as the limit of abandonment-count process, which does not satisfy the local Lipschitz condition so that the continuous mapping method in the literature of this area is invalid in our case.

It is shown that, if the number of phases is N, the number of customers in the system is order-N matrix-geometrically distributed, and the sojourn time is order-matrix-exponentially distributed, just like in the case of classical QBD queues without batches. Furthermore, phase-type representations are provided for both distributions. In the special case of the arrival and service processes being independent, further simplifications make it possible to obtain a more compact, order-N representation for the sojourn time distribution.",2015,2016-04,82,4-Mar,353-380,"Horv√°th, G√°bor (Hungarian Academy of Sciences; Budapest University of Technology and Economics)",Budapest University of Technology and Economics; Hungarian Academy of Sciences,2,0,,316

The job sizes are taken to be regularly varying. When the incoming jobs have finite variance, there are basically two types of effects that dominate the tail asymptotics. While the quantitative distinction between these two manifests itself only in the slowly varying components, the two effects arise from qualitatively very different phenomena (arrival of one extremely big job or two big jobs). Then there is a phase transition that occurs when the incoming jobs have infinite variance. In that case, only one of these effects dominates the tail asymptotics; the one involving arrival of one extremely big job.",2015,2015-12,81,4,301-340,"Blanchet, Jose (Columbia University); A.

We are interested in the performance of LQF for multihop traffic flows. In this scenario, the coupling between queues due to multihop traffic flows makes the local-pooling-factor analysis difficult to perform.

Similarly, fair sharing, for example, processor sharing (PS), is a widely accepted approach to resource allocation among multiple users. Recent work has shown that retransmissions in failure-prone, for example, wireless ad hoc, networks can cause heavy tails and long delays. In this paper, we discover a new phenomenon showing that PS-based scheduling induces complete instability with zero throughput in the presence of retransmissions, regardless of how low the traffic load may be. This phenomenon occurs even when the job sizes are bounded/fragmented, for example, deterministic. Our analytical results are further validated via simulation experiments. Moreover, our work demonstrates that scheduling one job at a time, such as first-come-first-serve, achieves a larger stability region and should be preferred in these systems.",2015,2015-11,81,3-Feb,171-202,"Jelenkoviƒá, Predrag R.

10.1007/s11134-016-9485-y,Queueing with redundant requests: exact analysis,"Recent computer systems research has proposed using redundant requests to reduce latency. The idea is to run a request on multiple servers and wait for the first completion (discarding all remaining copies of the request). However, there is no exact analysis of systems with redundancy. This paper presents the first exact analysis of systems with redundancy. We allow for any number of classes of redundant requests, any number of classes of non-redundant requests, any degree of redundancy, and any number of heterogeneous servers. In all cases we derive the limiting distribution of the state of the system. In small (two or three server) systems, we derive simple forms for the distribution of response time of both the redundant classes and non-redundant classes, and we quantify the ‚Äúgain‚Äù to redundant classes and ‚Äúpain‚Äù to non-redundant classes caused by redundancy. We find some surprising results. First, the response time of a fully redundant class follows a simple exponential distribution and that of the non-redundant class follows a generalized hyperexponential. Second, fully redundant classes are ‚Äúimmune‚Äù to any pain caused by other classes becoming redundant. We also compare redundancy with other approaches for reducing latency, such as optimal probabilistic splitting of a class among servers (Opt-Split) and join-the-shortest-queue (JSQ) routing of a class. We find that, in many cases, redundancy outperforms JSQ and Opt-Split with respect to overall response time, making it an attractive solution.",2016,2016-08,83,4-Mar,227-259,"Gardner, Kristen (Carnegie Mellon University); Zbarsky, Samuel (Carnegie Mellon University); Doroudi, Sherwin (Carnegie Mellon University); Harchol-Balter, Mor (Carnegie Mellon University); Hyyti√§, Esa (University of Iceland); Scheller-Wolf, Alan (Carnegie Mellon University)",Carnegie Mellon University; University of Iceland,37,23,,552
10.1007/s11134-016-9493-y,Comparisons of ticket and standard queues,"Upon arrival to a ticket queue, a customer is offered a slip of paper with a number on it‚Äîindicating the order of arrival to the system‚Äîand is told the number of the customer currently in service. The arriving customer then chooses whether to take the slip or balk, a decision based on the perceived queue length and associated waiting time. Even after taking a ticket, a customer may abandon the queue, an event that will be unobservable until the abandoning customer would have begun service. In contrast, a standard queue has a physical waiting area so that abandonment is apparent immediately when it takes place and balking is based on the actual queue length at the time of arrival. We prove heavy traffic limit theorems for the generalized ticket and standard queueing processes, discovering that the processes converge together to the same limit, a regulated Ornstein‚ÄìUhlenbeck process. One conclusion is that for a highly utilized service system with a relatively patient customer population, the ticket and standard queue performances are asymptotically indistinguishable on the scale typically uncovered under heavy traffic approaches. Next, we heuristically estimate several performance metrics of the ticket queue, some of which are of a sensitivity typically undetectable under diffusion scaling. The estimates are tested using simulation and are shown to be quite accurate under a general collection of parameter settings.",2016,2016-10,84,2-Jan,145-202,,Cornell University,23,10,,426

A server‚Äôs processing speed and buffer size (which may be finite or infinite) depend on the pool. The input flow of customers is split equally among a fixed number of routers, which must assign customers to the servers immediately upon arrival. We consider an asymptotic regime in which the total customer arrival rate and pool sizes scale to infinity simultaneously, in proportion to a scaling parameter n, while the number of routers remains fixed. We define and study a multi-router generalization of the pull-based customer assignment (routing) algorithm PULL, introduced in Stolyar (Queueing Syst 80(4): 341‚Äì361, 2015) for the single-router model. Under the PULL algorithm, when a server becomes idle it sends a ‚Äúpull-message‚Äù to a randomly uniformly selected router; each router operates independently‚Äîit assigns an arriving customer to a server according to a randomly uniformly chosen available (at this router) pull-message, if there is any, or to a randomly uniformly selected server in the entire system otherwise. Under Markov assumptions (Poisson arrival process and independent exponentially distributed service requirements), and under subcritical system load, we prove asymptotic optimality of PULL: as n‚the steady-state probability of an arriving customer experiencing blocking or waiting vanishes. Furthermore, PULL has an extremely low router‚Äìserver message exchange rate of one message per customer. These results generalize some of the single-router results in Stolyar

Customers arrive according to a Poisson process and join the queue promising the shortest expected delay, which is a natural and near-optimal policy for systems with nonidentical servers. This system can be modeled as an inhomogeneous random walk in the quadrant. By stretching the boundaries of the compensation approach we prove that the equilibrium distribution of this random walk can be expressed as a series of product forms that can be determined recursively.

This queueing system is useful to the modeling of multi-service systems subject to synchronization constraints, such as MapReduce clusters or multipath routing. Despite their apparent simplicity, FJ systems are hard to analyze. This paper provides the first computable stochastic bounds on the waiting and response time distributions in FJ systems under full (bijective) and partial (injective) mapping of tasks to servers. We consider four practical scenarios by combining (1a) renewal and (1b) non-renewal arrivals, and (2a) non-blocking and (2b) blocking servers.

Reconfiguration delays occur in a variety of communication settings, such as satellite, optical, or delay-tolerant networks. In the absence of reconfiguration delays it is well known that the celebrated Max-Weight scheduling algorithm guarantees throughput optimality without requiring any knowledge of arrival rates. As we will show, however, the Max-Weight algorithm may fail to achieve throughput optimality in case of nonzero reconfiguration delays. Motivated by the latter issue, we propose a class of adaptive scheduling algorithms which persist with the current schedule until a certain stopping criterion is reached, before switching to the next schedule. While earlier proposed Variable Frame-Based Max-Weight (VFMW) policies belong to this class, we also present Switching-Curve-Based (SCB) policies that are more adaptive to bursts in arrivals. We develop novel Lyapunov drift techniques to prove that this class of algorithms under certain conditions achieves throughput optimality by dynamically adapting the durations of the interswitching intervals.

The scheduler itself operates at a very fast time scale of milliseconds, but the objective function is related to minimizing the holding costs at a much longer time scale, at the so-called flow level. The Whittle index approach is a powerful tool in this context, since it renders the flow-level optimization problem with heterogeneous users tractable. Until now, this approach has been applied to the opportunistic scheduling problem to generate non-anticipating index policies that may depend on the amount of attained service but do not utilize the exact size information. In this paper, we produce a size-aware (i.e., anticipating) index policy by applying the Whittle index approach in a novel way. By a numerical study based on simulations, we demonstrate that the resulting size-aware index policy systematically improves performance. As a side result, we show that the opportunistic scheduling problem is indexable when the file sizes follow the Pascal distribution, and we derive the corresponding Whittle index, which generalizes earlier results.",2016,2016-08,83,4-Mar,195-225,"Aalto, Samuli (Aalto University); Lassila, Pasi (Aalto University); Osti, Prajwal (Aalto University)",Aalto University,10,3,,281

In such scenarios, the server(s) must balance abandonments from each phase of service with the need to prioritize higher reward customers. This presents an interesting challenge since the trade-off between the cost of abandonments and revenue maximization is not at all clear. As a result of customer abandonments, traditional solution techniques are not available. In particular, uniformization is not possible since the transition rates are unbounded. We do our analysis in continuous time, using the continuous-time Markov decision process framework to discern simple relationships of the value functions depending on the starting state. We then use sample path arguments to analyze the structure of the optimal policy. We provide conditions under which an optimal policy is nonidling and never splits servers (except to avoid idling).

Customers arrive at the two queues according to independent batch Markovian arrival processes. The first queue is served according to the gated service discipline, and the second queue is served according to a state-dependent time-limited service discipline with the preemptive repeat-different property. The state dependence is that, during each cycle, the predetermined limited time of the server‚Äôs visit to the second queue depends on the queue length of the first queue at the instant when the server last departed from the first queue. The mean of the predetermined limited time for the second queue either decreases or remains the same as the queue length of the first queue increases. Due to the two service disciplines, the customers in the first queue have higher service priority than the ones in the second queue, and the service fairness of the customers with different service priority levels is also considered. In addition, the switchover times for the server traveling between the two queues are considered, and their means are both positive as well as finite. First, based on two embedded Markov chains at the cycle beginning instants, the sufficient and necessary condition for the stability of the cyclic polling system is obtained. Then, the calculation methods for the variables related to the stability condition are given.

Otherwise, the optimal policy is more complex as servers must divide their time between stations. For Markovian systems with two stations and two servers, we characterize the optimal policy completely.

The pools of servers associated with different classes may overlap, so the sharing of server resources across classes is done via a dynamic allocation policy based on a fairness criterion. We consider an asymptotic regime where the total load increases proportionally with the system size. We show that under limited scaling in size of server pools the stationary distribution for activity of a fixed finite subset of servers has asymptotically a product form, which in turn implies a concentration result for server activity. In particular, we establish a clear connection between the scaling of server pools‚Äô size and asymptotic independence. Further, these results are robust to the service requirement distribution of jobs. For large-scale cloud systems where heterogeneous pools of servers collaborate in serving jobs of diverse classes, a concentration in server activity indicates that the overall power and network capacity that need to be provisioned may be substantially lower than the worst case, thus reducing costs.",2016,2016-06,83,2-Jan,13-28,"Shah, Virag (The University of Texas at Austin); de Veciana, Gustavo (The University of Texas at Austin)",The University of Texas at Austin,5,0,,242

The objective is to maximize the long-run average reward/throughput. We use sample-path comparisons to identify conditions on the network structure and service time distributions under which the optimal policy is an index policy. This index policy assigns the server to the non-empty station where it takes the shortest amount of time (in some stochastic sense) to complete a job. For example, in a network of multiple parallel stations, the optimal policy assigns the highest priority to the fastest station if service times can be ordered in likelihood ratios. Finally, by means of a numerical study, we test the shortest-expected-remaining-service-time policy on parallel-series networks with three stations and find that this index policy either coincides with the optimal policy or provides a near-optimal performance.",2016,2017-02,85,2-Jan,149-172,"Argon, Nilay Tanƒ±k (University of North Carolina System); Deng, Chao (University of North Carolina System); Kulkarni, Vidyadhar G.

Throughput expressions for TCP Compound under a deterministic loss model exist in the literature. These are obtained assuming that the window sizes are continuous, i.e., a fluid behavior is assumed. We validate this model theoretically. We show that under the deterministic loss model, the TCP window evolution for TCP Compound is asymptotically periodic and is independent of the initial window size. We then consider the case when packets are lost randomly and independently of each other. We discuss Markov chain models to analyze performance of TCP in this scenario. We use insights from the deterministic loss model to get an appropriate scaling for the window size process and show that these scaled processes, indexed by p, the packet error rate, converge to a limit Markov chain process as p goes to 0. We show the existence and uniqueness of the stationary distribution for this limit process. Using the stationary distribution for the limit process, we obtain approximations for throughput, under random losses, for TCP Compound when packet error rates are small.

Assuming that each arriving customer brings a certain amount of revenue, we are interested in calculating the value of an extra waiting place in terms of the expected amount of extra revenue that the queue will earn over a finite time horizon [0,¬†t]. There are different ways of approaching this problem. One involves the derivation of Markov renewal equations, conditioning on the first instance at which the state of the queue changes; a second involves an elegant coupling argument; and a third involves expressing the value of capacity in terms of the entries of a transient analogue of the deviation matrix.

Assuming exponential, class-dependent service requirements, we show that the joint distribution of the queue lengths of different customer classes under DPS undergoes a state-space collapse when subject to heavy-traffic scaling.

The cache is decomposed into lists. Some of these lists can be virtual in the sense that only meta-data are stored in those lists. An item enters the cache via the first list and jumps to the next list whenever a hit on it occurs. The classical policies FIFO, RANDOM, CLIMB, and its hybrids are obtained as special cases. We present explicit expressions for the cache content distribution and miss probability under the IRM model. We develop an algorithm with a time complexity that is polynomial in the cache size and linear in the number of items to compute the exact miss probability. We introduce lower and upper bounds on the latter that can be computed in a time that is linear in the cache size times the number of items. We introduce a mean-field model to approximate the transient behavior of the miss probability and prove that this model becomes exact as the cache size and number of items go to infinity. We show that the set of ODEs associated to the mean-field model has a unique fixed point that can be used to approximate the miss probability in case the exact computation is too time consuming. Using this approximation, we provide guidelines on how to select a replacement algorithm within the family considered such that a good trade-off is achieved between the cache reactivity and its steady-state hit probability. We simulate these cache replacement algorithms on traces of real data and show that they can outperform LRU.

Exponential decay of the shot noise is assumed, so that the queueing systems are amenable to analysis.

The major result of this paper is the presentation of approaches to fit the parameters of the model, namely the MMAP, the PH distribution and the parameters introducing correlation between inter-arrival and service times, according to some trace of inter-arrival and corresponding service times. Two different algorithms are presented. The first algorithm is based on available methods to compute a MAP from the inter-arrival times and a PH distribution from the service times. Afterward, the correlation between inter-arrival and service times is integrated by solving a quadratic programming problem over some joint moments.

Moreover, contrary to the M/G/1 queue, we show that the coefficient of variation of the service does not necessarily deteriorate the system performance. Next, we show that this queueing model may be the result of customers‚Äô strategic behavior when only the last event is known. Finally, we investigate the historical admission control problem.

When a type-i customer arrives, or retries, during a glue period of the station i, it will be served in the following service period of that station. Customers arriving at station i in any other period join the orbit of that station and will retry after an exponentially distributed time. Such polling systems can be used to study the performance of certain switches in optical communication systems. When the glue periods are exponentially distributed, we obtain equations for the joint generating functions of the number of customers in each station. We also present an algorithm to obtain the moments of the number of customers in each station. When the glue periods are generally distributed, we consider the distribution of the total workload in the system, using it to derive a pseudo-conservation law which in turn is used to obtain accurate approximations of the individual mean waiting times.

Our model is motivated by power-aware servers in data centers where dynamic scaling techniques are used. The service speed of the server is proportional to the number of jobs in the system. The contribution of our paper is threefold. First, we obtain the necessary and sufficient condition for the stability of the system. Second, we derive an expression for the probability generating function of the number of jobs in the system. Third, our main contribution is the derivation of the Laplace‚ÄìStieltjes transform (LST) of the sojourn time distribution, which is obtained in series form involving infinite-dimensional matrices. In this model, since the service speed varies upon arrivals and departures of jobs, the sojourn time of a tagged job is affected by the batches that arrive after it.

The users are selective and the matchings occur probabilistically. Recently, Markov chain models were proposed to analyze these systems; however, an exact analysis of these models to completely characterize the performance is not possible due to the probabilistic matching structure. In this work, we propose approximation methods based on fluid and diffusion limits using different scalings. We analyze the basic properties of these approximations and show that some performance measures are insensitive to the matching probability, agreeing with the existing results.

Seen alternatively, the algorithm provides a fast and approximate solution toward a constructive version of Carath√©odory‚Äôs Theorem for the Birkhoff polytope. The algorithm also has strong connections to submodular optimization, achieves a performance at least half that of the optimal schedule and strictly outperforms the state of the art in a variety of traffic demand settings.

Naturally, the balking is an outcome of the queue length, and the decision is based on a threshold. Yet the inspected queue length contains customers who balked. In this work, we consider a Markovian queue with infinite capacity and with customers that are homogeneous with respect to their cost reward functions. We show that that no threshold strategy can be a Nash equilibrium strategy. Furthermore, we show that for any threshold strategy adopted by all, the individual‚Äôs best response is a double threshold strategy. That is, join if and only if one of the following is true: (i) the inspected queue length is smaller than one threshold, or (ii) the inspected queue length is larger than a second threshold.

However, reaching the second server is costly and can go unrewarded because requests are blocked when the server is busy. Still, blocked customers do not leave the system empty-handed‚Äîthey are instantaneously rerouted to the shared queue at the first server. The decision and benefit of each customer depend on the choices of the others, bringing about a symmetric non-cooperative game. After analyzing the queueing characteristics of the system, we show, by properties of the cost function, that a unique symmetric Nash equilibrium exists.

One crucial feature of this model is that the abandonment behavior is affected by the system performance and vice versa. Our model captures this interaction by developing two closely related models: an abandonment model and a queueing model. In the abandonment model, customers take the virtual waiting time distribution as given. They receive a reward r from service and incur a cost c per period of waiting. Customers are forward-looking and maximize their expected discounted utilities by making wait or abandon decisions dynamically as they wait in the queue. The queueing model takes the customers‚Äô abandonment time distribution as an input and studies the resulting virtual waiting time distribution. In equilibrium, the customers‚Äô abandonment behavior and the system performance must be consistent across the two models. Therefore, combining the two models and imposing this consistency requirement, we show that there exists a unique equilibrium.

The constraint for this result to be valid is that arrivals, and also service completions, with probability one occur individually, i.e., not in batches. We show that it is easy to write down somewhat similar balance equations for multidimensional queue-length processes for a quite general network of multiclass multiserver queues. We formally derive those balance equations under a general framework. They are called distributional relationships and are obtained for any external arrival process and state-dependent routing as long as certain stationarity conditions are satisfied and external arrivals and service completions do not simultaneously occur.

Using standard generating function arguments, a simple expression for the blocking probability is derived, which as far as we know is original. Using coupling arguments and explicit formulas, comparisons with related loss systems are then provided. Bounds are similarly obtained for the average total number of customers, with the stationary distribution explicitly determined on.These expressions extend to the infinite capacity and asymmetric cases, i.e., when the queues have different service rates. For the initial symmetric finite capacity model, the stationary probabilities of states (0,¬†k) can be obtained recursively from the blocking probability. In the other cases, they are implicitly determined through a functional equation that characterizes their generating function.

The system manager operates an Erlang-C queueing system with a quality-of-service constraint on the probability that a customer is queued. However, in this model, the arrival rate is uncertain in the sense that even the arrival-rate distribution is not completely known to the manager. Rather, the manager has an estimate of the support of the arrival-rate distribution and the mean. The goal is to determine the number of servers needed to satisfy the quality-of-service constraint. Two cases are explored. First, the constraint is enforced on an overall delay probability, given the probability that different feasible arrival-rate distributions are selected. In the second case, the constraint has to be satisfied by every possible distribution.

Each invited agent arrives into the system after a random time; after each service completion, an agent returns to the system or leaves it with some fixed probabilities. Customers and/or agents may be impatient, that is, while waiting in queue, they leave the system at a certain rate (which may be zero). We consider the queue-length-based feedback scheme, which controls the number of pending agent invitations, depending on the customer and agent queue lengths and their changes. The basic objective is to minimize both customer and agent waiting times. We establish the system process fluid limits in the asymptotic regime where the customer arrival rate goes to infinity. We use the machinery of switched linear systems and common quadratic Lyapunov functions to approach the stability of fluid limits at the desired equilibrium point and derive a variety of sufficient local stability conditions. For our model, we conjecture that local stability is in fact sufficient for global stability of fluid limits; the validity of this conjecture is supported by numerical and simulation experiments.

The optimal policy is shown to be related to the monotonicity of the hazard rate function of the interarrival distribution. In particular, for decreasing hazard rates, timer policies outperform the static policy of caching the most popular contents. We provide explicit solutions for the optimal policy in the case of Pareto-distributed inter-request times and a Zipf distribution of file popularities, including a compact fluid characterization in the limit of a large number of files.

This model can be formulated as a Markov Decision Process (MDP) for which the optimal strategy has nice structural properties. In principle we can numerically compute the optimal decision in each state, but doing so can be computationally very demanding. A previously obtained approximation is computationally efficient for low and moderate loads, but for high loads also suffers from long computation times. In this paper, we exploit the structure of the optimal strategy and develop heuristic policies motivated by the analysis of a related controlled fluid problem. The fluid approach provides excellent approximations, and thus understanding, of the optimal MDP policy. The computational effort to determine the heuristic policies is much lower and, more importantly, hardly affected by the system load.

10.1007/s11134-017-9547-9,Asymptotically optimal open-loop load balancing,"In many distributed computing systems, stochastically arriving jobs need to be assigned to servers with the objective of minimizing waiting times. Many existing dispatching algorithms are basically included in the SQ(d) framework: Upon arrival of a job, servers are contacted uniformly at random to retrieve their state and then the job is routed to a server in the best observed state. One practical issue in this type of algorithm is that server states may not be observable, depending on the underlying architecture. In this paper, we investigate the assignment problem in the open-loop setting where no feedback information can flow dynamically from the queues back to the controller, i.e., the queues are unobservable. This is an intractable problem, and unless particular cases are considered, the structure of an optimal policy is not known. Under mild assumptions and in a heavy-traffic many-server limiting regime, our main result proves the optimality of a subset of deterministic and periodic policies within a wide set of (open-loop) policies that can be randomized or deterministic and can be dependent on the arrival process at the controller. The limiting value of the scaled stationary mean waiting time achieved by any policy in our subset provides a simple approximation for the optimal system performance.",2017,2017-12,87,4-Mar,245-267,"Anselmi, Jonatha (Inria Bordeaux - Sud-Ouest Research Centre)",Inria Bordeaux - Sud-Ouest Research Centre,1,0,,158

A complete analysis of stability is provided in the setting of Poisson arrivals and in that of the Markovian arrival process. The stability region depends upon the detailed structure of the interarrival and service time distributions and cannot be expressed purely in terms of expected values.

The performance of each client is measured by the amount of time that its video playback halts due to buffer underflow, which has been shown to have the most impact on clients‚Äô perceived quality of experience (QoE). This performance measure is significantly different from traditional quality of service metrics. We develop an analytic framework that jointly captures the video playback process and the unreliable and heterogeneous wireless channels. We use a diffusion limit to approximate the short-term QoE performance. We derive the capacity region for QoE by establishing a lower bound of a weighted sum of video halt durations over all clients. We then propose a QoE-optimal policy that can achieve every point within the capacity region. Finally, we compare our policy against two commonly used policies. Both theoretical analysis and simulation results show that our policy greatly outperforms other policies.",2017,2017-10,87,2-Jan,131-159,"Hou, I-Hong (Texas A&M University); Hsieh, Ping-Chun (Texas A&M University)",Texas A&M University,1,1,,323

We model the queueing primitives via polyhedral uncertainty sets inspired by the limit laws of probability. These uncertainty sets are characterized by variability parameters that control the degree of conservatism of the model. Assuming the inter-arrival and service times belong to such uncertainty sets, we obtain closed-form expressions for the worst case transient system time in multi-server queues and feed-forward networks with deterministic routing. These analytic formulas offer rich qualitative insights on the dependence of the system times as a function of the variability parameters and the fundamental quantities in the queueing system. To approximate the average behavior, we treat the variability parameters as random variables and infer their density by using ideas from queues in heavy traffic under reflected Brownian motion. We then average the worst case values obtained with respect to the variability parameters. Our averaging approach yields approximations that match the diffusion approximations for a single queue with light-tailed primitives and allows us to extend the framework to heavy-tailed feed-forward networks.

Beyond having their own intrinsic value, these mathematical models are also limits of corresponding many-server stochastic systems. We begin by analyzing a two-station tandem network with a general time-varying arrival rate, a finite waiting room before the first station, and no waiting room between the stations. In this model, customers that are referred from the first station to the second when the latter is saturated (blocked) are forced to wait in the first station while occupying a server there. The finite waiting room before the first station causes customer loss and, therefore, requires reflection analysis.

For this we consider a throughput expression for TCP CUBIC computed earlier under deterministic periodic packet losses. We validate this expression theoretically. We then use insights from the deterministic loss-based model to scale appropriately a sequence of Markov chains with random losses indexed by the probability of loss p. We show that this sequence converges to a limiting Markov chain as p tends to 0. The stationary distribution of the limiting Markov chain is then used to derive the average window size for small packet error rates. We then use a simple approximation to extend our current results with negligible queuing to a setup with multiple connections and non-negligible queuing.

Building on the recent work of Oblakova et al.¬†(Exact expected delay and distribution for the fixed-cycle traffic-light model and similar systems in explicit form, 2016), we obtain a contour-integral expression, reminiscent of Pollaczek integrals for bulk-service queues, for the probability generating function of the steady-state FCTL queue.

The customers are served on a first-come, first-served basis (FCFS) regardless of their class. Such systems are common in customer call centers, which often segment their arrivals into classes of callers whose requests differ in their complexity and criticality. We first consider an M/G/1+M queue and then analyze the M/M/k+M case. Analyzing these systems using a queue length process proves intractable as it would require us to keep track of the class of each customer at each position in the queue. Consequently, we introduce a virtual waiting time process where the service times of customers who will eventually abandon the system are not considered. We analyze this process to obtain performance measures such as the percentage of customers receiving service in each class, the expected waiting times of customers in each class, and the average number of customers waiting in queue. We use our characterization to perform a numerical analysis of the M/M/k + M system and find several managerial implications of administering a FCFS system with multiple classes of impatient customers. Finally, we compare the performance a system based on data from a call center with the steady-state performance measures of a comparable M/M/k+M system.

If a customer cannot be matched immediately, he/she will stay in a queue. We also assume customers are impatient with generally distributed patience times.

10.1007/s11134-018-9593-y,Reward maximization in general dynamic matching systems,"We consider a matching system with random arrivals of items of different types. The items wait in queues‚Äîone per item type‚Äîuntil they are ‚Äúmatched.‚Äù Each matching requires certain quantities of items of different types; after a matching is activated, the associated items leave the system. There exists a finite set of possible matchings, each producing a certain amount of ‚Äúreward.‚Äù This model has a broad range of important applications, including assemble-to-order systems, Internet advertising, and matching web portals. We propose an optimal matching scheme in the sense that it asymptotically maximizes the long-term average matching reward, while keeping the queues stable. The scheme makes matching decisions in a specially constructed virtual system, which in turn controls decisions in the physical system. The key feature of the virtual system is that, unlike the physical one, it allows the queues to become negative. The matchings in the virtual system are controlled by an extended version of the greedy primal‚Äìdual (GPD) algorithm, which we prove to be asymptotically optimal‚Äîthis in turn implies the asymptotic optimality of the entire scheme. The scheme is real time; at any time, it uses simple rules based on the current state of the virtual and physical queues.

In the heavy traffic limit, the main queue and retrial queue lengths jointly converge to a degenerate two-dimensional diffusion process. When this model is considered with holding and rejection costs, formal limits lead to a free boundary curve that determines a threshold on the main queue length as a function of the retrial queue length, above which arrivals must be rejected. However, it is known to be a notoriously difficult problem to characterize this curve. We aim instead at optimizing the threshold on the main queue length independently of the retrial queue length. Our main result shows that in the small and large retrial rate limits, this problem is governed by the Harrison‚ÄìTaksar free boundary problem, which is a Bellman equation in which the free boundary consists of a single point.

In the well-known number- and time-limited vacation policies, the server goes on vacation if the number of customers, respectively, work (time slots) served since the previous vacation reaches a specified value, or if the system becomes empty, whichever occurs first. However, in practice, the server does not always go on vacation when the system is empty if the number of customers/work to be served has not yet reached the specified amount. Therefore, we study modified number- and time-limited vacation policies, where we account for this feature. We complement our recent work on these vacation policies by considering a discrete time, instead of a continuous-time, setting.

Customers arrive to station 1 according to a Poisson process, and a gatekeeper, who has complete knowledge of the number of customers at both stations, decides whether to accept or reject each arriving customer. If a customer is rejected, a rejection cost is incurred. If an admitted customer finds that station 2 is full at the time of his service completion at station 1, he leaves the system and a loss cost is incurred. The goal is to find easy-to-implement policies that minimize long-run average cost per unit time. We formulate two intuitive, extremal policies and provide analytical results on their performances. We also present necessary and/or sufficient conditions under which each of these policies is optimal. Next, we show that for some states of the system it is always optimal to admit new arrivals. We also fully characterize the optimal policy when the capacity of each station is two and discuss some characteristics of optimal policies in general. Finally, we design heuristic admission control policies using these insights.

10.1007/s11134-019-09621-2,Redundancy scheduling with scaled Bernoulli service requirements,"Redundancy scheduling has emerged as a powerful strategy for improving response times in parallel-server systems. The key feature in redundancy scheduling is replication of a job upon arrival by dispatching replicas to different servers. Redundant copies are abandoned as soon as the first of these replicas finishes service. By creating multiple service opportunities, redundancy scheduling increases the chance of a fast response from a server that is quick to provide service and mitigates the risk of a long delay incurred when a single selected server turns out to be slow. The diversity enabled by redundant requests has been found to strongly improve the response time performance, especially in the case of highly variable service requirements. Analytical results for redundancy scheduling are unfortunately scarce however, and even the stability condition has largely remained elusive so far, except for exponentially distributed service requirements. In order to gain further insight in the role of the service requirement distribution, we explore the behavior of redundancy scheduling for scaled Bernoulli service requirements. We establish a sufficient stability condition for generally distributed service requirements, and we show that, for scaled Bernoulli service requirements, this condition is also asymptotically nearly necessary. This stability condition differs drastically from the exponential case, indicating that the stability condition depends on the service requirements in a sensitive and intricate manner.",2019,2019-10,93,2-Jan,67-82,"Raaijmakers, Youri (Eindhoven University of Technology); Borst, Sem (Eindhoven University of Technology; Nokia (United States)); Boxma, Onno (Eindhoven University of Technology)",Eindhoven University of Technology; Nokia (United States),12,12,,798

The customers are served in batches by a single server according to the random serving capacity rule, and the service times are geometrically distributed. We model the system via the supplementary variable technique and further use the displacement operator method to solve the non-homogeneous difference equation. The analysis done using these methods results in an explicit expression for the steady-state queue-length distribution at pre-arrival and arbitrary epochs simultaneously, in terms of roots of the underlying characteristic equation. Our approach enables one to estimate the asymptotic distribution at a pre-arrival epoch by a unique largest root of the characteristic equation lying inside the unit circle. With the help of few numerical results, we demonstrate that the methodology developed throughout the work is computationally tractable and is suitable for light-tailed inter-arrival distributions and can also be extended to heavy-tailed inter-arrival distributions.

These vehicles need to be charged and will therefore cause congestion in local distribution grids in the future. Motivated by this, we consider a charging station with finitely many parking spaces, in which electric vehicles arrive in order to get charged. An EV has a random parking time and a random charging time. Both the charging rate per vehicle and the charging rate possible for the station are assumed to be limited. Thus, the charging rate of uncharged EVs depends on the number of cars charging simultaneously. This model leads to a layered queueing network in which parking spaces with EV chargers have a dual role, of a server (to cars) and a customer (to the grid). We are interested in the performance of the aforementioned model, focusing on the fraction of vehicles that get fully charged. To do so, we develop several bounds and asymptotic (fluid and diffusion) approximations for the vector process which describes the total number of EVs and the number of not fully charged EVs in the charging station, and we compare these bounds and approximations with numerical outcomes.",2019,2019-10,93,2-Jan,83-137,"Aveklouris, Angelos (Eindhoven University of Technology); Vlasiou, Maria (Eindhoven University of Technology); Zwart, Bert (Eindhoven University of Technology; National Research Institute for Mathematics and Computer Science)",Eindhoven University of Technology; National Research Institute for Mathematics and Computer Science,7,7,,1158

Despite the wide attention this problem has received, tight analysis is still largely unknown since analyzing job delay requires characterizing the complicated correlation among task delays, which is hard to do.

Capital assets, such as wind turbines in a wind park, require maintenance throughout their long lifetimes. Two types of preventive maintenance are considered: planned maintenance at periodic, scheduled opportunities, and opportunistic maintenance at unscheduled opportunities. The latter type of maintenance arises due to the network context: When an asset in the network fails, this constitutes an opportunity for preventive maintenance for the other assets in the network. So as to increase the realism of the model at hand and its applicability to various sectors, we consider the option of not-deferring and of deferring planned maintenance after the occurrence of opportunistic maintenance. We also assume that preventive maintenance may not always restore the condition of the system to ‚Äòas good as new.‚Äô By formulating this problem as a semi-Markov decision process, we characterize the optimal policy as a control limit policy (depending on the remaining time until the next planned maintenance) that indicates on the one hand when it is optimal to perform preventive maintenance and on the other hand when maintenance resources should be shared if an opportunity in the network arises. In order to facilitate managerial insights on the effect of each parameter on the cost, we provide a closed-form expression for the long-run rate of cost for any given control limit policy (depending on the remaining time until the next planned maintenance) and compare the costs (under the optimal policy) to those of suboptimal policies that neglect the opportunity for resource sharing.

More specifically, customers arrive according to a Poisson process at the first stage of the system, where they do not receive any service, but wait until a number K of them are accumulated. Then, these K customers form a batch which is instantaneously transferred to the second stage where the batches are served sequentially, as single units, by a single server. We derive customer equilibrium strategies, regarding the joining/balking dilemma, for the (partially) observable case where the customers are informed upon arrival about the number of present customers at the first stage. We prove the existence and study the uniqueness of equilibrium strategies and give a simple procedure for their computation. Moreover, we juxtapose the customer strategic behavior in this system with the corresponding behavior in the unobservable system and study the effect of information on the resulting social welfare per time unit under equilibrium.",2019,2019-10,93,2-Jan,29-Mar,"Bountali, Olga (University of Toronto); Economou, Antonis (National and Kapodistrian University of Athens)",University of Toronto; National and Kapodistrian University of Athens,5,5,,391

10.1007/s11134-019-09639-6,Analysis of polling models with a self-ruling server,"Polling systems are systems consisting of multiple queues served by a single server. In this paper, we analyze polling systems with a server that is self-ruling, i.e., the server can decide to leave a queue, independent of the queue length and the number of served customers, or stay longer at a queue even if there is no customer waiting in the queue. The server decides during a service whether this is the last service of the visit and to leave the queue afterward, or it is a regular service followed, possibly, by other services. The characteristics of the last service may be different from the other services. For these polling systems, we derive a relation between the joint probability generating functions of the number of customers at the start of a server visit and, respectively, at the end of a server visit. We use these key relations to derive the joint probability generating function of the number of customers and the Laplace transform of the workload in the queues at an arbitrary time. Our analysis in this paper is a generalization of several models including the exponential time-limited model with preemptive-repeat-random service, the exponential time-limited model with non-preemptive service, the gated time-limited model, the Bernoulli time-limited model, the 1-limited discipline, the binomial gated discipline, and the binomial exhaustive discipline. Finally, we apply our results on an example of a new polling discipline, called the 1¬†+¬†1 self-ruling server, with Poisson batch arrivals.

The service provider quotes prices to incoming customers using either a static or dynamic pricing scheme. There may also be a holding cost for each customer in the system. The objective is to maximize either the discounted profit over an infinite planning horizon or the long-run average profit of the provider. We show that there exists an optimal dynamic policy that exhibits a monotone structure, in which the quoted price is non-decreasing in the queue length at either station and is non-increasing if a customer moves from station 1 to 2, for both the discounted and long-run average problems under certain conditions on the holding costs. We then focus on the long-run average problem and show that the optimal static policy performs as well as the optimal dynamic policy when the buffer size at station 1 becomes large, there are no holding costs, and the arrival rate is either small or large. We learn from numerical results that for systems with small arrival rates and no holding cost, the optimal static policy produces a gain quite close to the optimal gain even when the buffer at station¬†1 is small. On the other hand, for systems with arrival rates that are not small, there are cases where the optimal dynamic policy performs much better than the optimal static policy.",2019,2019-08,92,4-Mar,323-396,"Wang, Xinchang (Mississippi State University); Andrad√≥ttir, Sigr√∫n (Georgia Institute of Technology); Ayhan, Hayriye (Georgia Institute of Technology)",Georgia Institute of Technology; Mississippi State University,3,3,,269

This class of systems includes the bulk-service queue and the fixed-cycle traffic-light (FCTL) queue, which is a basic model in traffic-control research and can be seen as a non-exhaustive time-limited polling system. Our method avoids finding the roots of the characteristic equation, which enhances both the reliability and the speed of the computations compared to the classical root-finding approach. We represent the queue-length expectation in an exact closed-form expression using a contour integral. We also introduce several realistic modifications of the FCTL model. For the FCTL model for a turning flow, we prove a decomposition result. This allows us to derive a bound on the difference between the bulk-service and FCTL expected queue lengths, which turns out to be small in most of the realistic cases.",2019,2019-08,92,4-Mar,257-292,"Oblakova, A.

Then these are exploited to obtain the joint transform of the numbers of customers, at various time epochs, in a single infinite-server queue fed by the above-mentioned Cox process.

In this work, we study the effect of batch arrivals on infinite server queues. We assume that the arrival epochs occur according to a Poisson process, with treatment of both stationary and non-stationary arrival rates. We consider both exponentially and generally distributed service durations, and we analyze both fixed and random arrival batch sizes. In addition to deriving the transient mean, variance, and moment-generating function for time-varying arrival rates, we also find that the steady-state distribution of the queue is equivalent to the sum of scaled Poisson random variables with rates proportional to the order statistics of its service distribution. We do so through viewing the batch arrival system as a collection of correlated sub-queues. Furthermore, we investigate the limiting behavior of the process through a batch scaling of the queue and through fluid and diffusion limits of the arrival rate.

The case of two interacting queues results in a two-dimensional random walk with bounded transitions to non-neighboring states, which in turn results in complicated boundary behavior. Although this system violates the conditions of the compensation approach due to the transitions to non-neighboring states, we show how to extend the framework of the approach and how to apply it to the system at hand. Moreover, as an additional level of theoretic validation, we have compared the results obtained with the compensation approach with those obtained using the power series algorithm and we have shown that the compensation approach outperforms the power series algorithm in terms of numerical efficiency. In addition to the fundamental contribution, the results obtained are also of practical value, since our analysis constitutes a first attempt toward gaining insight into the performance of such interacting queues under the join the shortest queue policy. To fully comprehend the benefits of such a protocol, we compare its performance to the Bernoulli routing scheme as well as to that of the single relay system.

We demonstrate that the compensation approach is the only method that may lead to such a type of invariant measure. In particular, we show that if a countably infinite sum of geometric terms is an invariant measure, then the geometric terms in an invariant measure must be the union of at most six pairwise-coupled sets of countably infinite cardinality each. We further show that for such invariant measure to be a countably infinite sum of geometric terms, the random walk cannot have transitions to the north, northeast or east.

There are two streams of customers, one informed about the server‚Äôs state upon arrival (idle or busy) and the other not informed. Both informed and uninformed customers decide whether to join the system or not upon arrival. Upon joining, customers who are faced with a busy server will retry several times until the server is idle to acquire service. The interval of retrials is exponentially distributed. We investigate equilibrium strategies for the customers and study the impact of information heterogeneity on the system throughput and social welfare. We find that social welfare is increasing in the fraction of informed customers and the maximum social welfare is reached when all customers are informed about the state of the server. On the other hand, we find that when the workload is low (or high), the throughput-maximizing server should conceal (or disclose) the state of the server to customers. When the workload falls in an intermediate range, information heterogeneity in the population (i.e., revealing the information to a certain portion of customers) leads to more efficient outcomes. Finally, numerical analyses are presented to verify our results and illustrate the impact of the retrial behavior on the system performance.",2019,2019-06,92,2-Jan,131-172,"Wang, Zhongbin (Beijing Jiaotong University); Wang, Jinting (Beijing Jiaotong University)",Beijing Jiaotong University,2,1,,438

Arriving early induces a higher waiting cost (waiting before service begins) while arriving late induces a cost because earlier arrivals take the better seats. We first consider arrivals of heterogenous customers that choose arrival times to minimize the weighted sum of waiting cost and cost due to expected number of predecessors. We characterize the unique Nash equilibria for this system. Next, we consider a system offering L levels of priority service with a FCFS queue for each priority level. Higher priorities are charged higher admission prices. Customers make two choices‚Äîtime of arrival and priority of service. We show that the Nash equilibrium corresponds to the customer types being divided into L intervals and customers belonging to each interval choosing the same priority level. We further analyze the net revenue to the server and consider revenue maximizing strategies‚Äînumber of priority levels and pricing.

To this end, we consider the last-block-column-linearly-augmented (LBCL-augmented) truncation of the (infinitesimal) generator of the upper block-Hessenberg Markov chain. The LBCL-augmented truncation is a linearly augmented truncation such that the augmentation distribution has its probability mass only on the last block column. We first derive an upper bound for the total variation distance between the respective stationary distribution vectors of the original generator and its LBCL-augmented truncation. Based on the upper bound, we then establish a series of linear fractional programming (LFP) problems to obtain augmentation distribution vectors such that the bound converges to zero. Using the optimal solutions of the LFP problems, we construct a matrix-infinite-product (MIP) form of the original (i.e., not approximate) stationary distribution vector and develop a sequential update algorithm for computing the MIP form.

Under a scaling assumption, the evolution of the number of urgent calls blocked at level¬†1 is investigated. It is shown that if the ratio of the number of operators at level 2 and¬†1 is greater than some threshold, then, essentially, the system operates without congestion, with probability close to 1 no urgent call is blocked after some finite time.

We prove that critical fluid model solutions converge to the set of invariant states as time goes to infinity, uniformly for all initial conditions lying in certain relatively compact sets. This generalizes an earlier single-class result of Puha and Williams to the more complex multiclass setting. In particular, several new challenges are overcome, including formulation of a suitable relative entropy functional and identifying a convenient form of the time derivative of the relative entropy applied to trajectories of critical fluid model solutions.",2019,2019-12,93,4-Mar,351-397,"Mulvany, Justin A.

10.1007/s11134-019-09624-z,Admit or preserve? Addressing server failures in cloud computing task management,"Cloud computing task management has a critical role in the efficient operation of the cloud resources, i.e., the servers. The task management handles critical and complicated decisions, overcoming the inherent dynamic nature of cloud computing systems and the additional complexity due to the large magnitude of resources in such systems (tens of thousands of servers). Due to the fact that servers may fail, task management is required to conduct both task admissions and task preservation decisions. Moreover, both these decisions require considering future system trajectories and the interplay between preservation and admission. In this paper we study the combined problem of task admission and preservation in a dynamic environment of cloud computing systems through analysis of a queueing system based on a Markov decision process (MDP). We show that the optimal operational policy is of a double switching curve type. On face value, the extraction of the optimal policy is rather complicated, yet our analysis reveals that the optimal policy can be reduced to a single rule, since the rules can effectively be decoupled. Based on this result, we propose two heuristic approaches that approximate the optimal rule for the most relevant system settings in cloud computing systems. Our results provide a simple policy scheme for the combined admission and preservation problem that can be applied in a complex cloud computing environments, and eliminate the need for sophisticated real-time control mechanisms.",2019,2020-04,94,4-Mar,279-325,"Lavi, Nadav (Tel Aviv University); Levy, Hanoch (Tel Aviv University)",Tel Aviv University,0,0,,184

Assuming mild conditions for the parameters, a dynamic programming formulation is developed. We show that under the infinite horizon discounted problem, there exists an optimal threshold policy and provide conditions for a customer class to be preferred for each fixed time, extending stationary results to the non-stationary setting. We approximate the non-stationary problem by discretizing the time horizon into equally spaced intervals and examine how policies for this approximation change as a function of time and parameters numerically. We compare the performance of these approximations with several admission policies used in practice in a discrete-event simulation study. We show that simpler admission policies that ignore non-stationarity or abandonments lead to significant losses in rewards.",2019,2020-02,94,2-Jan,175-210,"Zayas-Cab√°n, Gabriel (University of Wisconsin‚ÄìMadison); Lewis, Mark E.

10.1007/s11134-019-09605-2,Replicate to the shortest queues,"This paper introduces a load-balancing policy that interpolates between two well-known policies, namely join the shortest queue (JSQ) and join the least workload (JLW), and studies it in heavy traffic. This policy, which we call replicate to the shortest queues (RSQ(d)), routes jobs from a stream of arrivals into buffers attached to N servers by replicating each arrival into  replicas are canceled. Clearly, RSQ(1) is equivalent to JSQ, and it has been shown that RSQ(N) is equivalent to JLW; intermediate values of d provide a trade-off between good performance measures of JSQ and those of JLW. In heavy traffic, a key property underlying asymptotic analysis of load-balancing policies is state space collapse (SSC). Unlike policies such as JSQ, where SSC is well understood, the treatment of SSC under RSQ(d) requires addressing the massive cancellations that highly complicate the queue length dynamics. Our first main result is that SSC holds under RSQ(d) for possibly heterogeneous servers. Based on this result, we obtain diffusion limits for the queue lengths in the form of one-dimensional reflected Brownian motion, asymptotic characterization of the short-time-averaged delay process and a version of Reiman‚Äôs snapshot principle. We illustrate using simulations that as d increases the server workloads become more balanced, and the delay distribution‚Äôs tail becomes lighter.

10.1007/s11134-019-09598-y,Temporal starvation in multi-channel CSMA networks: an analytical framework,"In this paper, we consider a stochastic model for a frequency-agile CSMA protocol for wireless networks where multiple orthogonal frequency channels are available. Even when the possible interference on the different channels is described by different conflict graphs, we show that the network dynamics can be equivalently described as that of a single-channel CSMA algorithm on an appropriate virtual network. Our focus is on the asymptotic regime in which the network nodes try to activate aggressively in order to achieve maximum throughput. Of particular interest is the scenario where the number of available channels is not sufficient for all nodes of the network to be simultaneously active and the well-studied temporal starvation issues of the single-channel CSMA dynamics persist. For most networks, we expect that a larger number of available channels should alleviate these temporal starvation issues. However, we prove that the aggregate throughput is a non-increasing function of the number of available channels. To investigate this trade-off that emerges between aggregate throughput and temporal starvation phenomena, we propose an analytic framework to study the transient dynamics of multi-channel CSMA networks by means of first hitting times. Our analysis further reveals that the mixing time of the activity process does not always correctly characterize the temporal starvation in the multi-channel scenario and often leads to pessimistic performance estimates.",2019,2019-04,91,4-Mar,241-263,"Zocca, Alessandro (California Institute of Technology)",California Institute of Technology,0,0,,196

The two-point distribution for the interarrival time has one mass point at 0, but the service-time distribution involves a limit; there is one mass point at a high value, but that upper mass point must increase to infinity while the probability on that point must decrease to 0 appropriately. In this paper, we develop effective numerical and simulation algorithms to compute the value of this conjectured tight bound. The algorithms are aided by reductions of the special queues with extremal interarrival-time and extremal service-time distributions to D/GI/1 and GI/D/1 models. Combining these reductions yields an overall representation in terms of a D/RS(D)/1 discrete-time model involving a geometric random sum of deterministic random variables (the RS(D)), where the two deterministic random variables in the model may have different values, so that the extremal steady-state waiting time need not have a lattice distribution.

Under renewal assumptions, we derive explicit solutions for their Laplace transforms and show some interesting decomposition properties. Previous work has mostly focused on computation of expectations in very particular cases. We argue that using bufferless or very small buffer systems is best and support this by simulation.

However, in many cases, either the information might be delayed or customers might require time to travel to the queue of their choice, thus causing a lag in information. In this paper, we construct a neutral delay differential equation model for the queue length process and explore the use of velocity information in our delay announcement. Our results illustrate that using velocity information can have either a beneficial or detrimental impact on the system. Thus, it is important to understand how much velocity information a manager should use. In some parameter settings, we show that velocity information can eliminate oscillations created by delays in information. We derive a fixed point equation for determining the optimal amount of velocity information that should be used and find closed-form upper and lower bounds on its value. When the oscillations cannot be eliminated altogether, we identify the amount of velocity information that minimizes the amplitude of the oscillations. However, we also find that using too much velocity information can create oscillations in the queue lengths that would otherwise be stable.",2020,2020-08,95,4-Mar,281-330,"Novitzky, Sophia (Cornell University); Pender, Jamol (Cornell University); Rand, Richard H.

10.1007/s11134-020-09674-8,Deterministic state-based information disclosure policies and social welfare maximization in strategic queueing systems,"Understanding the impact of the queue length information on the behavior of customers is nowadays a hot topic for strategic queueing problems. Particularly, it is important to understand how this information impacts the equilibrium behavior and therefore global performance metrics in order to give some recommendations to service providers for optimizing their objective. Recent works are focused on information policies in order to optimize the provider‚Äôs profit. In this work, the aim is to maximize the expected social welfare. It is intuitive that the expected social welfare is higher when more information is available to new customers. In some circumstances, and particularly when the queue is overloaded, providing the information up to a particular level of occupancy yields a better expected social welfare compared to always providing queue length information to new customers. This counterintuitive result comes mainly from the strategic behavior of customers at equilibrium when queue length information is not available. After proving that there exists such an optimal information disclosure policy (IDP) for arbitrary arrival and service rates, we go further and study the expected social welfare for the overloaded context in which the arrival rate equals the service rate. Finally, numerical illustrations corroborate our contributions, and moreover, they show that an admission control policy can be also proposed, combined with an IDP, in order to optimize the expected social welfare of the system.",2020,2020-12,96,4-Mar,303-328,"Naceur, Tesnim (University of Avignon); Hayel, Yezekael (University of Avignon)",University of Avignon,0,0,,180

In many cases, the queue implements the optimal admission control (either discounted or average) policy in the presence of holding/congestion cost and revenue collected from admitted customers. In this paper, users offer an arrival rate at stationarity that depends on the QoS they experience. We study the interaction between arriving customers and such a queue under two different QoS measures‚Äîthe asymptotic rate of the customers lost and the fraction of customers lost in the long run. In particular, we investigate the behaviour of equilibrium points and equilibrium sets associated with this interaction and their interpretations in terms of business cycles. We provide sufficient conditions for existence of equilibrium sets for M/M/1 queue. These conditions further help us to identify the relationship among system parameters for which equilibrium sets exist. Next, we consider GI/M/1 queues and provide a sufficient condition for existence of multiple optimal revenue policies. We then specialize these results to study the equilibrium sets of (i) a D/M/1 queue and (ii) a queue where the arrival rate is locally continuous. The equilibrium behaviour in the latter case is more interesting as there may be multiple equilibrium points or sets. Motivated by such queues, we introduce a weaker version of monotonicity and investigate the existence of generalized equilibrium sets.",2020,2020-12,96,4-Mar,245-284,"Hemachandra, N.

We compare their performance numerically with simulations and conclude that GA performs better than KA in the bilinear case. We next formulate an optimal control problem to maximize the total net revenue over a fixed time horizon T by controlling the arrival rate of taxis. We solve the optimal control problem numerically and compare its performance to the real system.

The purpose of this paper is to assess the rate of convergence in these so-called diffusion approximations, in a queueing context.

Men arrive to the system following a Poisson process and wait till jobs are assigned to them. Jobs arrive to the system following another, independent, Poisson process. An arriving job must be assigned to a waiting man immediately, or be discarded, ensuing no gain. An assignment of a job to a man yields a higher gain if they match in trait, and a lower one if not. Each man waits a limited time for a job and leaves the system if unassigned by that time limit. It is stipulated that a man who arrives first has priority to either accept the pending job, or to pass it to the next man, who makes a similar decision. The last man in the line takes the job, or it is discarded. The individually optimal policy for each man is defined by some critical time for accepting a mismatched job. We solve for the critical times, depending on the mens‚Äô place in the queue, and obtain expressions for the ensuing optimal value functions of this system, for expected gain.

10.1007/s11134-021-09717-8,A survey of queueing systems with strategic timing of arrivals,"Consider a population of customers, each of which needs to decide independently when to arrive to a facility that provides a service during a fixed period of time, say a day. This is a common scenario in many service systems such as a bank, lunch at a cafeteria, music concert, flight check-in and many others. High demand for service at a specific time leads to congestion that comes at a cost, for examlple, for waiting, earliness or tardiness. Queueing theory provides tools for the analysis of the waiting times and associated costs. If customers have the option of deciding when to join the queue, they will face a decision dilemma of when to arrive. The level of congestion one suffers from depends on others, behavior and not only that of the individual under consideration. This fact leads customers to make strategic decisions regarding their time of arrival. In addition, multiple decision makers that affect each other‚Äôs expected congestion call for noncooperative game-theoretical analysis of this strategic interaction. This common daily scenario has prompted a research stream pioneered by the ?/M/1 model of Glazer and Hassin (Eur J Oper Res 13(2):146‚Äì150, 1983) that first characterized an arrival process to a queue as a Nash equilibrium solution of a game. This survey provides an overview of the main results and developments in the literature on queueing systems with strategic timing of arrivals.

(Queueing Syst 19(4):345‚Äì359, 1995), expanded the family of multi-class queues that are known to have a product-form stationary distribution by allowing for intricate class-dependent service rates. This paper further broadens this family by introducing pass-and-swap (P&S) queues, an extension of OI queues where, upon a service completion, the customer that completes service is not necessarily the one that leaves the system. More precisely, we supplement the OI queue model with an undirected graph on the customer classes, which we call a swapping graph, such that there is an edge between two classes if customers of these classes can be swapped with one another. When a customer completes service, it passes over customers in the remainder of the queue until it finds a customer it can swap positions with, that is, a customer whose class is a neighbor in the graph. In its turn, the customer that is ejected from its position takes the position of the next customer it can be swapped with, and so on. This is repeated until a customer can no longer find another customer to be swapped with; this customer is the one that leaves the queue. After proving that P&S queues have a product-form stationary distribution, we derive a necessary and sufficient stability condition for (open networks of) P&S queues that also applies to OI queues. We then study irreducibility properties of closed networks of P&S queues and derive the corresponding product-form stationary distribution. Lastly, we demonstrate that closed networks of P&S queues can be applied to describe the dynamics of new and existing load-distribution and scheduling protocols in clusters of machines in which jobs have assignment constraints.",2021,8/1/21,98,4-Mar,275-331,"Comte, C√©line (Eindhoven University of Technology); Dorsman, Jan-Pieter (University of Amsterdam)",University of Amsterdam; Eindhoven University of Technology,1,1,,484

10.1007/s11134-021-09694-y,In-queue priority purchase: a dynamic game approach,"Pay-for-priority is a common practice in congestion-prone service systems. The extant literature on this topic restricts attention to the case where the only epoch for customers to purchase priority is upon arrival, and if customers choose not to upgrade when they arrive, they cannot do so later during their wait. A natural alternative is to let customers pay and upgrade to priority at any time during their stay in the queue, even if they choose not to do so initially. This paper builds a queueing-game-theoretic model that explicitly captures self-interested customers‚Äô dynamic in-queue priority-purchasing behavior. When all customers (who have not upgraded yet) simultaneously decide whether to upgrade, we find in our model that pure-strategy equilibria do not exist under some intuitive criteria, contrasting the findings in classical models where customers can only purchase priority upon arrival. However, when customers sequentially decide whether to upgrade, threshold-type pure-strategy equilibria may exist. In particular, under sufficiently light traffic, if the number of ordinary customers accumulates to a certain threshold, then it is always the second last customer who upgrades, but in general, it could be a customer from another position, and the queue-length threshold that triggers an upgrade can also vary with the traffic intensity. Finally, we find that in-queue priority purchase subject to the sequential rule yields less revenue than upon-arrival priority purchase in systems with small buffers.",2021,2021-04,97,4-Mar,343-381,"Wang, Zhongbin (Nankai University); Yang, Luyi (University of California, Berkeley); Cui, Shiliang (Georgetown University); Wang, Jinting (Central University of Finance and Economics)","Georgetown University; Central University of Finance and Economics; Nankai University; University of California, Berkeley",1,1,,1476
10.1007/s11134-021-09685-z,"Balancing admission control, speedup, and waiting in service systems","Admission control and service rate speedup may be used during periods of congestion to minimize customer waiting in different service settings. In a healthcare setting, this can mean sending patients to alternative care facilities that may take more time and/or provide less ideal treatment. While waiting can be detrimental to patient outcomes, strategies used to control congestion can also be costly. In this work, we examine a multi-server queueing system that considers both admission control and speedup. We use dynamic programming to characterize properties of the optimal control and find that in some instances the optimal policy has a simple form of a threshold policy. Leveraging this insight, we examine a queueing system where speedup is used when the number of customers (patients) in the system exceeds some threshold and admission control is used when that number exceeds some (potentially different) threshold. Using a fluid model and a stochastic loss model, we develop a methodology to derive approximations for the probability that speedup will be applied, the probability that admission control will be applied and the expected queue length customers experience. We use the approximations as the basis for a greedy heuristic to derive a near optimal solution to the original stochastic optimization problem. We use simulation to demonstrate the quality of these approximations and find that they can be quite accurate and robust. This analysis can provide insight to managers deciding how to balance admission control and speedup in service settings: when and to what extent to use each.",2021,2021-02,97,2-Jan,163-219,"Yom-Tov, Galit B.

10.1007/s11134-020-09683-7,Strategic arrivals to a queue with service rate uncertainty,"We study the problem of strategic choice of arrival time to a single-server queue with opening and closing times when there is uncertainty regarding service speed. A Poisson population of customers choose their arrival time with the goal of minimizing their expected waiting times and are served on a first-come first-served basis. There are two types of customers that differ in their beliefs regarding the service-time distribution. The inconsistent beliefs may arise from randomness in the server state along with noisy signals that customers observe. Customers are aware of the two types of populations with differing beliefs. We characterize the Nash equilibrium dynamics for exponentially distributed service times and show how they substantially differ from the model with homogeneous customers. We further provide an explicit solution for a fluid approximation of the game. For general service-time distributions we provide an algorithm for computing the equilibrium in a discrete-time setting. We find that in equilibrium customers with different beliefs arrive during different (and often disjoint) time intervals. Numerical analysis further shows that the mean waiting time increases with the coefficient of variation of the service time. Furthermore, we present a learning agent-based model (ABM) in which customers make joining decisions based solely on their signals and past experience. We numerically compare the long-term average outcome of the ABM with that of the equilibrium and find that the arrival distributions are quite close if we assume (for the equilibrium solution) that customers are fully rational and have knowledge of the system parameters, while they may greatly differ if customers have limited information or computing abilities.",2021,2021-04,97,4-Mar,303-341,"Ravner, Liron (University of Amsterdam; Eindhoven University of Technology); Sakuma, Yutaka (National Defense Academy of Japan)",Eindhoven University of Technology; National Defense Academy of Japan; University of Amsterdam,1,1,,202
10.1007/s11134-021-09721-y,The cost of collaboration,"Multi-class multi-server systems, in which each job class can be served by a subset of servers, are common in a wide variety of applications. In such systems, a key question is whether to collaborate, allowing a job to be in service on multiple servers simultaneously, or not to collaborate. For systems with redundancy and exponential service times, this question is equivalent to the question of whether to cancel copies of a job once a copy starts service or once a copy completes service. While the collaborative and noncollaborative systems have been well studied in steady state, existing results have not allowed for a comprehensive comparison of performance in the two systems. In this paper, we use a combination of steady-state analysis and sample-path arguments to study the costs and benefits of collaboration. While intuition says that collaboration should yield substantial benefits when service times are not correlated, we find that, surprisingly, this is not the case. In systems that exhibit symmetry among servers or job classes, we can construct coupled sample paths so that collaboration indeed always outperforms noncollaboration. However, in all systems the benefit of collaboration is limited: we show that on sample paths with the same arrival and service processes, there is an upper bound on this benefit, in terms of the number of jobs in system. On the other hand, collaboration can be arbitrarily worse than noncollaboration on sample paths with the same input processes. Ultimately, both in steady state and sample-path wise, the two systems typically achieve similar response times, indicating that collaboration is never a big win and that, in many real-world systems, noncollaboration may be the better choice.",2021,,,,Jan-34,"Gardner, Kristen (Amherst College); Righter, Rhonda (University of California, Berkeley)","University of California, Berkeley; Amherst College",0,0,,80

In this context, we consider the continuous-space M/G/1-FCFS queue endowed with an arbitrarily designed cost function for the waiting times of the incoming jobs. The associated relative value function is a solution of Poisson‚Äôs equation for Markov chains, which in this work we solve in the Laplace transform domain by considering an ancillary, underlying stochastic process extended to (imaginary) negative backlog states. This construction enables us to issue closed-form relative value functions for polynomial and exponential cost functions and for piecewise compositions of the latter, in turn permitting the derivation of interval bounds for the relative value function in the form of power series or trigonometric sums. We review various cost approximation schemes and assess the convergence of the interval bounds these induce on the relative value function, namely Taylor expansions (divergent, except for a narrow class of entire functions with low orders of growth) and uniform approximation schemes (polynomials, trigonometric), which achieve optimal convergence rates over finite intervals. This study addresses all the steps to implementing dispatching policies for systems of parallel servers, from the specification of general cost functions toward the computation of interval bounds for the relative value functions and the exact implementation of the first-policy improvement step.",2021,2021-12,99,4-Mar,199-230,"Bilenne, Olivier ()",,0,0,,154

There are two parallel, observable first-come, first-served queues with finitely many servers: one queue has a faster service rate, but charges a fee to join, and the other is free but slow. Upon arrival, customers see the state of each queue and choose between them by comparing the respective disutility of time spent waiting, subject to random shocks. This framework encompasses both the multinomial logit and exponomial customer choice models. Using a fluid limit approximation, we give a detailed characterization of the equilibrium in this system. We show that social welfare is optimized when the express queue is exactly at (but not over) full capacity; however, in some cases, revenue is maximized by artificially creating congestion in the free queue. The latter behavior is caused by changes in the price elasticity of demand as the service capacity of the free queue fills up.",2021,2021-12,99,4-Mar,243-281,"Zhou, Jiaqi (University of Maryland, College Park); Ryzhov, Ilya O.

Subcritical LIFO queueing networks with Poisson external arrivals are known to be stable, but an open problem has been whether this is also the case when external arrivals are given by renewal processes. Here, we show that this weaker assumption is not sufficient for stability by constructing a family of examples where the number of jobs in the network increases to infinity over time. This behavior contrasts with that for the other classical disciplines: processor sharing (PS), infinite server (IS) and first-in, first-out (FIFO), which are stable under general conditions on the renewals of external arrivals. Together with LIFO, PS and IS constitute the classical symmetric disciplines; with the inclusion of FIFO, these disciplines constitute the classical homogeneous disciplines.

In this paper, we study a closed Markovian queueing network that allows for spare batteries under a dynamic arrival policy. We propose a provisioning rule for the capacity levels and show that these lead to near-optimal resource utilization, while guaranteeing good quality-of-service levels for electric vehicle users.

Such ‚Äúnetworked‚Äù devices and resources which are distributed in a physical space and provide services are collectively referred to as a distributed service network. Assigning users or applications to available resources is important to sustain high performance of the distributed service network. In this work, we consider a one-dimensional service network where both users and resources are located on a line, and analyze a unidirectional assignment policy Move To Right (MTR), which sequentially assigns users to resources available to their right. We express the communication cost for a user-resource assignment as an increasing function of the distance traveled by the user request (request distance) and analyze the expected communication cost for the service network when locations of users and resources are modeled by different spatial point processes. We use results from the literature that map the request distance of an assigned user in a one-dimensional service network to the sojourn time of a customer in an exceptional service accessible batch queueing system. We compute the Laplace‚ÄìStieltjes transform of the sojourn time distribution for this queueing system for Poisson distributed users with general inter-resource distance distributions and in the process also generate new results for batch service queues. Unlike previous work (Panigrahy et al. in Perform Eval 142:102, 2020), our framework not only captures the first-order moment of the request distance, but also the request distance distribution itself, thus allowing us to compute the expected communication cost under different cost models.",2021,2021-06,98,2-Jan,181-207,"Nain, Philippe (Inria Grenoble - Rh√¥ne-Alpes research centre); Panigrahy, Nitish K.

After being served, each customer either successfully completes the service and departs the system with probability q, or the service fails and the customer immediately joins the end of the queue to wait to be served again until she successfully completes it. We analyze this decision problem as a noncooperative game among the customers. We show that there exists a unique symmetric Nash equilibrium threshold strategy. We then prove that the symmetric Nash equilibrium threshold strategy is evolutionarily stable. Moreover, if we relax the strategy restrictions by allowing customers to renege, in the new Nash equilibrium, customers have a greater incentive to join.

In this paper, we analyze the queue length behavior of a switch with nonzero reconfiguration delay operating under the Adaptive MaxWeight. We first show that the Adaptive MaxWeight policy exhibits a weak state space collapse behavior in steady state, which can be viewed as an inheritance of a similar property of the MaxWeight policy in a switch with zero reconfiguration delay. The weak state space collapse result is then utilized to obtain an asymptotically tight bound on an expression involving the steady-state queue length and the probability of reconfiguration for the Adaptive MaxWeight policy in the heavy traffic regime. We then derive the relation between the expected schedule duration and the steady-state queue length through Lyapunov drift analysis and characterize bounds for the expected steady-state queue length. While the resulting queue length bounds are not asymptotically tight, they suggest an approximate queue length scaling behavior, which approaches the optimal scaling with respect to the traffic load and the reconfiguration delay when the hysteresis function of the Adaptive MaxWeight policy approaches a linear function.",2021,2021-06,98,2-Jan,49-93,"Wang, Chang-Heng (University of California, San Diego); Maguluri, Siva Theja (Georgia Institute of Technology); Javidi, Tara (University of California, San Diego)","Georgia Institute of Technology; University of California, San Diego",0,0,,123
10.1007/s11134-021-09692-0,A busy period approach to some queueing games,"The traditional approach when looking for a symmetric equilibrium behavior in queueing models with strategic customers who arrive according to some stationary arrival process is to look for a strategy which, if used by all, is also a best response of an individual customer under the resulting stochastic steady-state conditions. This description lacks a key component: a proper definition of the set of players. Hence, many of these models cannot be defined as proper noncooperative games. This limitation raises two main concerns. First, it is hard to formulate these models in a canonical way, and hence, results are typically limited to a specific model or to a narrow class of models. Second, game theoretic results cannot be applied directly in the analysis of such models and call for ad hoc adaptations. We suggest a different approach, one that is based on the stationarity of the underlying stochastic processes. In particular, instead of considering a system that is functioning from time immemorial and has already reached stochastic steady-state conditions, we look at the process as a series of isolated, a priori identical, and independent strategic situations with a random, yet finite, set of players. Each of the isolated games can be analyzed using existing tools from the classical game theoretic literature. Moreover, this approach suggests a canonic definition of strategic queueing models as properly defined mathematical objects.

For the continuous strategy space, we show that a unique pure-strategy Nash equilibrium exists that can be found using a best-response algorithm. For the discrete strategy space, we show that the game has a Nash equilibrium in mixed strategies, but need not have a pure-strategy Nash equilibrium. We show the existence of pure-strategy Nash equilibria for four subclasses: (i) N-player games with equal arrival rates for the players, (ii) 2-player games with identical service rates for all nodes, (iii) 2-player games on a  grid with small differences in the service rates.",2021,2021-04,97,4-Mar,279-301,"Laan, Corine M.

Our results indicate that size-based service policies may not use the available resources efficiently in a multiserver network setting and in fact cause instability effects. This is in sharp contrast with their satisfactory performance for single-server queues.",2022,,,,Jan-36,"Kruk, ≈Åukasz (Maria Curie-Sk≈Çodowska University); Chojecki, Tymoteusz (Maria Curie-Sk≈Çodowska University)",Maria Curie-Sk≈Çodowska University,0,0,,8

10.1007/s11134-021-09724-9,Appointment-driven queueing systems with non-punctual customers,"We consider a single-server queueing system where a finite number of customers arrive over time to receive service. Arrivals are driven by appointments, with a scheduled appointment time associated with each customer. However, customers are not necessarily punctual and may arrive either earlier or later than their scheduled appointment times or may not show up at all. Arrival times relative to scheduled appointments are random. Customers are not homogeneous in their punctuality and show-up behavior. The time between consecutive appointments is allowed to vary from customer to customer. Moreover, service times are assumed to be random with a Cox distribution, a class of phase-type distributions known to be dense in the field of positive distributions. We develop both exact and approximate approaches for characterizing the distribution of the number of customers seen by each arrival. We show how this can be used to obtain the distribution of waiting time for each customer. We prove that the approximation provides an upper bound for the expected customer waiting time when non-punctuality is uniformly distributed. We also examine the impact of non-punctuality on system performance. In particular, we prove that non-punctuality deteriorates waiting time performance regardless of the distribution of non-punctuality. In addition, we illustrate how our approach can be used to support individualized appointment scheduling.",2022,,,,Jan-56,,Shanghai Jiao Tong University; VU Amsterdam; CentraleSup√©lec; University of Minnesota,0,0,,24

10.1007/s11134-021-09722-x,Regulation of a single-server queue with customers who dynamically choose their service durations,"In recent years, there is a growing attention towards queueing models with customers who choose their service durations. The model assumptions in the existing literature imply that every customer knows his service demand when he enters into the service position. Clearly, this property is not consistent with some real-life situations. Motivated by this issue, the current work includes a single-server queueing model with customers who dynamically choose their service durations. In this setup, the main result is existence of a quadratic price function which (1) implies an optimal resource allocation from a social point of view and (2) internalizes the externalities in the system. In addition, it is explained how to compute its parameters efficiently.",2022,,,,Jan-46,"Jacobovic, Royi (Hebrew University of Jerusalem)",Hebrew University of Jerusalem,0,0,,19
